<p>
	So here we go, yet another blog for me, but this time for something a little
	different than what I usually (<a
		href="https://www.project240z.com/"
		target="_blank"
		>project350z.com</a
	>, <a href="https://www.project240z.com/" target="_blank">project240z.com</a>,
	dnndaily.com (no longer around),
	<a href="https://www.autocrossblog.com/">solo2.org</a>)!
</p>

<p>
	Some may ask, who are you? Well, I am
	<a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/">Chris Hammond</a>, I’m a 34 year old
	software guy. What do I know about bikes? Well, to be honest, not much, but I
	figured as I go on this new journey (into the world of bicycles) I would keep
	a record of all the things I learn! So I picked up this domain name (along
	with .net and .org) last year, but am just now getting around to putting it to
	use.
</p>

<p>
	So here we are, I’ve setup a Twitter account (<a
		href="https://twitter.com/bicycletips"
		target="_blank"
		>@bicycletips</a
	>), this website, a quick logo, quick header image (using a simple CSS
	override for the MultiFunction Free DotNetNuke Skin. and now I have this first
	post coming together. What will hopefully be the first of many many more to
	come. In fact, I wrote this post first, but I really have a whole other post I
	wanted to write. I just felt like I couldn’t write that one, until I
	semi-launched this site with a first post.

	What should you expect from BicycleTips.com?

<p>
	Well the goal for this website is to provide a single location for all the
	“tips” I come across in my exploits learning to ride a bike. Alright, so I
	learned to ride a bike a LONG time ago (29 or 30 years ago), but I am just now
	(in the past few weeks) getting back into it. I haven’t really ridden a bike
	since I was probably 13 or 14.
</p>

<p>
	As new posts are added, and the content here becomes more in depth, you’ll be
	able to click on the list of “categories” or tags on the left side of the Tips
	page to see other posts. Right now, being the beginning of this website we
	don’t have those categories listed just yet, but will be adding them shortly.
</p>

<p>
	So sit back, grab a drink, and enjoy the ride here at
	<a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/" target="_blank">BicycleTips.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	Update 5/13/2024: This site no longer runs on DotNetNuke, and hasn’t for a few
	years.
