											It is (past) that time of year, Pedal The Cause 2019. Here
											in St. Louis Pedal The Cause is one of, if not the,
											biggest charity bike rides you can find. It takes place on
											the beautiful cycling roads of west county, starting in
											Chesterfield, spending most of its time in Wildwood, with
											a little loop down to Eureka as well depending on the
											length of the ride you do. You can even cross the Missouri
											River and ride in St. Charles County and Maryland Heights
											if you choose the Two Bridges route.
										</p>

										<p>
											The event offers a variety of distances, from spinning on
											site at the Chesterfield Amphitheater, a 10 Mile (PTC
											Circuit), 20 Mile (PTC Classic), 37 Mile (Two Bridges), 50
											Mile (Big Hitter), 62 Mile (Metric Century) to the&nbsp;
											98 Mile (Century). Ranging in Elevation from 321 feet to
											4,809 feet for the century. Depending on the distance you
											sign up for, and when you sign up, you commit to raising a
											certain level of funds. Riding the Century route, and
											registering before July 1st, I committed to raising at
											least $600, had I signed up after July 1st, I would have
											needed to commit to $1,000.
										</p>

										<p>
											In previous years I had ran on the Team ASG-SPS team, but
											this year I changed things up. I wanted to try to put
											together a team for the gym we go to, so I started the
											<a
												href="https://www.mypedalthecause.org/team_profile.jsp?MemberID=128241"
												target="_blank"
												>CrossFit Wildwood team</a
											>. We had 7 members total on the team, 2 other members
											from CrossFit Wildwood, 2 members from the ASG-SPS team,
											and my kids signed up for the team challenge. We set a
											team goal of raising $5,000, which I'll be honest, a few
											weeks ago, it seemed like we wouldn't get anywhere close
											to that goal. But as of right now, we have $4,695, and I
											believe we have another $2,000 coming in from a fund
											raising event we held with the St. Louis Region SCCA Solo
											program back on the 22nd of September.
										</p>

										<p>
											I haven't figured out what will happen with the team next
											year, if I can get a few more CrossFit Wildwood members to
											join the team and ride, we will&nbsp; keep it going,
											otherwise might just switch back to the ASG-SPS team with
											Dave and Beth.
										</p>

										<p>
											So how did Sunday go? Well, it was both WET and HOT. The
											morning started out with wet roads from a morning shower
											that came through before the start of the ride. It didn't
											rain too much, if at all, during the ride, but much of the
											roads were wet throughout the day. You had to breath
											through your nose while you were riding as to not
											collect/drink spray from the rider in front of you, and at
											each rest stop you needed to clean your glasses. The
											morning started out very humid in the mid 70s, and only
											went UP from there. It ultimately got HOT. So hot that
											they actually closed down a section of the course, the
											Babler Beast, the inner loop around Babler State Park.
										</p>

										<p>
											I started the ride with Aaron, riding with the Stifel
											team, but also a member at CrossFit Wildwood. We took off
											at a decent clip, but started towards the back of the
											group, so we couldn't totally gun it to try to stay with
											the fastest riders. Through Chesterfield Valley I feel
											like we could of used a larger pack for more speed, but we
											kept up a good clip and had a great conversation along the
											way. We skipped the first aid station at the Taubman
											outlets, and kept pedaling to get to the other side of the
											valley to stop at the aid station at the John L. LeCave
											Memorial Trailhead at the end of the Monarch Levy Trail.
											If I recall correctly, this was about mile 24 into the
											ride. Here I refilled a bottle with Gatorade, took a shot
											of pickle juice and had a half a PB&amp;J sandwich.
										</p>

										<p>
											From there we headed out towards Wildhorse Creek and then
											up Ossenfort. I told Aaron not to worry about waiting for
											me, as much riding as I've done this year, I feel like my
											hill climbing hasn't been very good, so I figured he would
											be much faster up the hills and I wouldn't see him again.
											I am pleased to say I kept up with him for the first two
											hills, Ossenfort and Little Tavern. Once we got up to
											Hencken though, I was cooked and he was much faster. We
											met back up at the aid station in Greensfelder, and headed
											south on Allenton together.
										</p>

										<p>
											The loop south of 44 in Eureka is a pretty rough road, and
											steep climb to start, at this point I lost sight of Aaron
											and would only see him at two more rest stops going
											forward. Going up this first hill south of 44 I got really
											upset. I was climbing along, struggling, and I hear what I
											thought was a car behind me, I even started to yell "car
											back" to the riders ahead of me when I turned and saw an
											older gentleman cruising up and past me on his e-bike.
											This triggered me, here I was struggling, and here goes
											this guy just casually pedaling along, assisted, with
											ease. I really wasn't mad at him, but I was upset with
											jealousy. Later in the day, when he passed me 3 or 4 more
											times going up different hills, that's when I started to
											get upset. Good for him, he's out riding. But man, if
											you're going to pass a slow guy on climbs with your
											e-bike, stay in front of him so you don't have to insult
											him EVERY DAMN HILL there is.
										</p>

										<p>
											At the top of Allenton I stopped at the Greensfelder aid
											station again and went to the bike mechanic for some lube.
											My chain was loud as could be, and I hoped they could help
											me. I don't know why I put dry lube on the bike two nights
											before, at the
											<a
												href="https://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/46"
												target="_blank"
												>Hermann Gravel challenge</a
											>
											I learned that the dry lube comes right off in the wet
											conditions and makes a hell of a racket when it does. I
											was able to get some lube and the bad sounds went away for
											the rest of the day. From Greensfelder (the second time)
											you head back to Melrose, down and then up through
											Rockwoods Reservation back up to Old Manchester. Old
											Manchester goes west back out to Melrose and up to where
											Ossenfort and Melrose meet. At this point I stopped to
											rest in the shade a bit and chat with another gym Member,
											Beahm, who was volunteering at the aid station. I
											questioned his choice in Music, the guy must be late 20s,
											MAYBE early 30s, but he's rocking classic rock like it is
											going out of style. He must of been raised here in St.
											Louis listening to KSHE through his youth instead of 105.7
											The Point.
										</p>

										<p>
											From there you head down Ossenfort, which is always
											questionable when wet, by this point in the afternoon many
											of the shaded roads were still wet, even though the heat
											was climbing. My Garmin recorded a 99 degree temperature
											reading around there. From the base of Ossenfort it was
											down towards Highway T. This section of the ride, in the
											past, always sucks. You are completely exposed, no shade,
											going up an incline back towards Highway 100. For some
											reason, 2019 was different. I felt revived on this stretch
											of road and managed to pass two riders ahead of me and get
											across 100 and back on to Old Manchester in record time
											(for me). It was still sunny, and hot, but it didn't drain
											me along Highway T like I expected.
										</p>

										<p>
											Then it was a run east on Old Manchester to Pond, out to
											Babler State Park. I was definitely getting hot, and not
											pushing for any PRs along this section of the route. I was
											looking forward to Babler, because the aid station there
											typically has orange bandanas sitting in a cooler full of
											ice water, and on a hot day, these bandanas go a long way
											to making you feel cooler/better.
										</p>

										<p>
											I arrived at Babler, with the intention of grabbing an ice
											cold bandana, and then heading into the park for the
											"Babler Beast", a counter clockwise loop of the park with
											a hell of a climb towards the end. Unfortunately when I
											asked for a bandana, I was told they didn't have any, and
											offered a cold paper towel. I said I would just grab one
											on the way back through, after doing the loop, but was
											quickly told that they had closed the part of the course
											in the park. Due to heat and injuries, they shut it down.
											I honestly was not too thrilled with this news. I have
											been training for Pedal The Cause all year, with the
											intention of finishing the full ride this year, something
											I've only done once previously.
										</p>

										<p>
											I wasn't about to let this stop me, so I headed up the
											chute to where the close was closed, and I just went.
											<sup
												>They chased me, they yelled, they event sent a police
												helicopter, but I went anyways</sup
											>. I ended up completing the loop, in probably one of my
											slowest times ever, but I completed it. I was definitely
											hot at this point, so I made sure to take my time, and
											rested before going up the big climb. As I was going up
											the climb, I decided to stop and take two breaks, instead
											of stopping and walking, I let my heart rate come back
											down and relaxed. I also didn't want to overheat and need
											medical assistance, especially after I went against the
											ride's wishes, so I took my time, and I made my way around
											Babler State Park.
										</p>

										<p>
											When I stopped to rest at the Babler aid station again I
											noticed that two other riders came in behind me, also
											deciding to take to the closed section of the course. I
											ran into Steve at this point, who unfortunately told me he
											was experiencing cramping issues again. Wasn't much I
											could offer him, so I went ahead and&nbsp; left Babler and
											headed out for what I knew would be the worst part of the
											course. For me the last 20 miles of Pedal the cause every
											year is the worst. You have one hill, Reiger, which isn't
											too bad, then you head down Wildhorse, a steep descent and
											then follow along the creek for 3-4 miles. After that you
											head down to Centaur and back to the LeCave trailhead.
											This section of the road isn't too bad, but when you're
											doing it solo you just want to be done. I'm typically
											riding this section of road with other riders, but for
											Pedal I always seem to be by myself, so it gets lonely to
											run by yourself.
										</p>

										<p>
											After the aid station at Centaur, you head down the Levy
											trail and then through Chesterfield Valley back up a climb
											on Baxter to the amphitheater. The first 3 miles on the
											Levy trail were great, the wind was at my back, and my
											riding was quick, After passing under the Boone bridge you
											go east, RIGHT INTO A DAMN HEADWIND (it was actually from
											the southeast, so&hellip; it go worse). I lost 6mph on my
											speed into this wind, and I was going to be heading
											east/southeast the rest of the ride. This is where I
											broke. I simply couldn't keep any speed up, my motivation
											was sapped. I wasn't about to give up on the ride, but my
											pedaling slowed, and I was passed by 3 individuals within
											the last 1/2 mile of the finish.
										</p>

										<p>98.24 miles according to my Garmin</p>

											></iframe>
										</p>

										<p>
											After the ride I had intentions of grabbing Sugarfire BBQ,
											but I was completely spent. I grabbed two bottles of
											Propel from the cheer/dance team handing out medals and
											water at the finish, found some shade and laid down for 20
											minutes to recover.
										</p>

										<p>
											A big thank you to everyone who rode this year,
											volunteered this year, and anyone who donated to any pedal
											the cause rider or team. Aaron finished his first century,
											by riding some extra distance afterwards to get to the
											full 100 miles. Dave finished 73 miles, cutting out some
											of the course due to the conditions. Steve unfortunately
											had to get the SAG wagon back to the event start,
											seccumbing to the cramps.
										</p>

										<p>
											Now it is back to Gravel season. I'll be getting my Niner
											RLT setup this week and will be back on gravel roads to
											get ready for the Cuban Gravel Crisis coming up in less
											than two weeks.
