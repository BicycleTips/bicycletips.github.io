<p>Waking up late this morning, missing the opportunity to ride due to weather, I logged into Facebook and came across this great video that was posted today.</p>

<p>Being new into bicycling I can honestly say that I don't say much of these things yet, but I yearn for the day</p>

<p>This video was put together by <a href="https://www.peopleforbikes.org/" target="_blank">PeopleForBikes.org</a> be sure to check out their website.</p>
