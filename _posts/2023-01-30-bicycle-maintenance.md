Bike Maintenance Instructions:

1. Cleaning:
* Regular cleaning is an essential part of bike maintenance. Before performing any maintenance, you should start by cleaning the bike frame, chain, gears, and other parts.
* To clean the bike, you'll need a degreaser and a soft cloth. Apply the degreaser to the areas that need cleaning, such as the chain, gears, and frame, and scrub gently with the cloth.
* This will help remove grime and dirt that can build up over time. Once you've finished cleaning, rinse the bike with water to remove any leftover degreaser.
2. Lubrication:
* After cleaning, you should lubricate the chain and gears.
* A good lubricant will help protect the metal parts from rust and corrosion, and it will also make the bike run more smoothly.
* Apply a few drops of lubricant to the chain, and then use a clean cloth to spread it evenly. Be sure to lubricate the gears as well, especially those that are exposed to the elements.
3. Tires:
* Check the tires for proper pressure and inspect them for damage or wear.
* If you're using a road bike, you should aim for a pressure of around 100-130 psi, while mountain bikes typically require a lower pressure of around 30-50 psi.
* If the pressure is too low, use a pump to fill the tires to the correct level.
* Check the tires for cuts, punctures, or other signs of damage, and replace the tire if necessary.
4. Brakes:
* Check the brake pads for wear and adjust if needed.
* If the brake pads are worn down to the metal, they will need to be replaced.
* Check the brake cables as well, and make sure they are tightened properly.
* If the brakes are not functioning properly, you may need to take the bike to a professional mechanic for a more in-depth inspection.
5. Drivetrain:
* Check the tightness of the bolts on the crank arm, pedals, and bottom bracket, and tighten any that are loose.
* Check the gears to make sure they are shifting smoothly.
* If the gears are not shifting properly, you may need to adjust the derailleur.
6. Steering:
* Check the tightness of the stem bolts, headset, and handlebar, and tighten any that are loose.
* Make sure the handlebars are positioned correctly, and that the bike is easy to steer.
* If the steering feels loose or wobbly, you may need to take the bike to a professional mechanic for further inspection.
7. Suspension:
* If your bike has suspension, it's important to check it regularly to make sure it's functioning properly.
* Check for proper suspension function and adjust accordingly.
* If the suspension feels stiff or bouncy, you may need to make some adjustments.
8. Wheel true:
* Ensure that the wheels spin straight and true.
* If the wheels are not true, you may need to make some adjustments to keep the bike riding smoothly.
9. Chain wear:
* Over time, the chain will start to wear down and stretch.
* To check for chain wear, use a chain wear indicator tool.
* If the chain is worn, it will need to be replaced to avoid damage to the gears.
* A worn chain will cause shifting problems, so it's important to replace it promptly.
10. Final Inspection:
* After performing all the above checks and maintenance, give the bike a final inspection.
* Test ride the bike to ensure it is running smoothly and everything is functioning properly.
* Check the brakes, gears, and steering, and make any necessary adjustments.
* If anything seems out of place, take the bike back to a professional mechanic for further inspection.

*Note:* Regular maintenance is important to keep your bike running smoothly and to extend its lifespan. If you are unsure about performing any of these maintenance tasks, take the bike to a professional mechanic for assistance.
