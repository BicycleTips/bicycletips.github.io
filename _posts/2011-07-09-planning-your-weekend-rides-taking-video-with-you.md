So what all does everyone have planned for their weekend rides? Personally I'm hoping to take the Cannondale Quick CX1 out for a ride on both Saturday and Sunday. If I can get the time I'll try to put in at least 25 miles between the two days.

I have yet to try to hook up my [GoPro camera](https://amzn.to/4dzpxtP) on the bike yet, I use it fairly heavily when [autocrossing my 350z](https://www.autocrossblog.com/category/350z). I was going to hook it up last weekend but ended up not coming up with a good mounting system. I see that REI carries a Helmet Front Mount as well as a Handlebar/Seat Post Mount for the GoPro. I'm not too keen on doing the helmet mount, I can only imagine the extra weight that would add.

Another thing I might try is the Chest Mount Harness for the GoPro. I've used my GoPro for quite a bit of timelapse at various events, the chest harness would come in handy for that, and possibly riding?
