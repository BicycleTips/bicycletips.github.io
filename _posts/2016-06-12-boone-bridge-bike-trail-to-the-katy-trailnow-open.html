<p>In case you missed the news, the bike path connecting the Monarch Levy trail, and the Katy Trail opened up last week (week of June 10th, 2016).</p><p>The new bridge has been in the works for a couple of years now, and while the car lanes opened up a while back, the bike path had been closed until last week.</p><p>We can now ride from our house in Wildwood, to a trail that crosses nearly all of the state of Missouri (Katy Trail) with only having to ride on 8 miles of roadway to do it. I look forward to taking advantage of this luxury, with the hopes of riding the entire Katy Trail sometime in 2017.</p>
