So my goal for 2011 was to hit 500 miles, I started in early June and hit it around the end of November, I thought that was pretty good. Well if that was good for a big guy like me, 2012 is going to be kickass! I hit 500 miles on the bike today for 2012, with 2 days left to spare in February.

In January I did 256 miles, and for February I've done 245. Of those 501 miles I've climbed around 20930 feet, with 11,417 of that coming in February, and 3k of that coming on my <a href="https://app.strava.com/rides/4280953">ride up Tunitas Creek last weekend</a>.

I've still got a long way to go in 2012, my big goal is the 100 miles at Team LIVESTRONG Challenge in Davis California on June 24. In addition to that I'm doing a 100k with the Santa Rosa Cycling Club in May, and maybe even that 60k in Gilroy in April.

If you're interested in either riding with me, or donating to my LIVESTRONG ride, check out <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/philanthropy.aspx">https://www.chrishammond.com/philanthropy.aspx</a>
