    So this isn't going to be a long tip, as this topic will likely fill out future tips as well, but for now I will raise a question.</p>

<p>How do you track your rides?</p>

<p>Or, do you track your rides?</p>

<p>At this point in time I use <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/" target="_blank">Garmin Connect</a> and <a href="http://www.sportstracklive.com/" target="_blank">SportstrackLive.com</a>. Why do I use both? Well I have a Garmin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSWCQA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B000CSWCQA" target="_blank">Forerunner 305</a> that I use, mounted to the handlebars on the bike, with a heart rate monitor and cadence monitor. It tracks things rather well, bit I figure having two sources of data can't hurt. For SportstrackLive I use my Motorola Droid, running Android 2.2.2. SportstrackLive works alright, though I haven't bothered to get any attachments for it (heart rate, or cadence).</p>

<p>I find that I like the Garmin website interface better than STL, but to be honest, both of them leave me wanting more. I feel like I should get more out of the websites. Neither of them seem to provide me anything along the lines of "hey someone else rides the same place you do".</p>

<p>Being that my wife and I are just getting into the bicycling thing, I wonder if riding would be more interesting (not that it isn't right now) if we rode with other people? Someone to push/pull us along?</p>

<p>Watching the Tour this year, I've seen plenty of advertisements for MapMyRide, but I've yet to try the software out yet. Anyone have any experience/opinion on it?</p>

<p>I do find that having the data drives me to ride more. I like being able to run reports on my riding to see that I've put in 161 miles since May 1st.</p>
