I"_<p>So Dirty Kanza had their &ldquo;virtual gravel camp&rdquo; this weekend. Going into this, I figured it would be leading up to something. Some change, I assumed a cancellation for 2020 and reschedule for 2021, due to coronavirus. I was wrong (I am glad I was), this evening they announced that they were moving the ride to September 12th, 2020.</p>
