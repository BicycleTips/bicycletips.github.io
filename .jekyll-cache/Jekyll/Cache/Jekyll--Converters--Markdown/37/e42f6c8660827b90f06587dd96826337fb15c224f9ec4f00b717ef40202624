The year that took away interactions with coworkers, friends, family. The year that took away jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2020 is also the year that thousands of people purchased bicycles for the first time in a long time and started riding. Thousands of them out there, on the trails, some even on the streets. E-Bikes, mountain bikes, road bikes, cruisers, you name it, they are out there. We were out there with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally fall 2020 was supposed to be consumed with the Pedal The Cause charity ride here in St. Louis, followed by the Cuban Gravel Crisis in Cuba, Missouri, and wrap up October with the Big Sugar Gravel ride in Bentonville, Arkansas. Well, all that got tossed out the window. With all the rides gone, we started planning our own adventure. Taking on the full 237 miles of the Katy Trail, for myself, again, and for Wagner and Luigi it would be their first time. We were the three bearded amigos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During initial planning we had upwards of 8 guys that were going to do the ride, but as we got into the month of August and I started pushing for people to commit, the numbers dwindled.<a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/home/2020/09/2020-katy-trail-shakedown-ride">Back at the beginning of September we did a shakedown ride to get gear tested out</a>. We’ll possibly do another post in the future on what gear we took/used/didn’t need to carry, but I won’t cover much of that in this writeup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planned Route&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 1: Clinton to Pilot Grove (60 miles)   <br /> Day 2: Pilot Grove to Portland (90 miles)   <br /> Day 3: Portland to Machens (90 miles)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning out the ride we decided to do the same direction as three of us did back in 2017, West to East, starting in Clinton, MO and finishing in Machens, Mo. Why west to east? Three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The wind typically blows west to east.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The elevation on the Katy Trail is primarily on the western half, so get that out of the way earlier in the ride. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We live near St. Louis, figuring we wouldn’t want to do a 3-4 hour car drive after finishing, a 30-45 minute drive home is much more appealing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally we planned to do this over 4 days, not the aggressive three day ride like ‘17. The plan was to start late Thursday morning, finishing up late Sunday morning. That all changed a few times though, when we departed Clinton on Day 1 we had the above route in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Katy Trail Stats&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;<strong>Direction: </strong>West to East&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;<strong>Number of Days: </strong>3&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;<strong>Dates:</strong> October 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 2020&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;<strong>Total Distance Rode</strong>: 249.5 miles&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;<strong>Total Time on Trail</strong>: 27 hours 48 minutes&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;<strong>Total Moving Time</strong>: 19 hours 53 minutes&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;<strong>Longest Day:</strong> Day 3&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;<strong>Shortest Day:</strong> Day 1&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;<strong>Max Speed:</strong> 25.5mph&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;<strong>Moving Average Speed:</strong> 12.5mph&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;<strong>Overall Average Speed:</strong> 9mph&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Day 1 – Thursday 65 Miles Clinton to Pilot Grove (<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/4139181219" target="_blank">Strava Ride</a>)&lt;/h2&gt;<img alt="Katy Trail Clinton Missouri Trailhead" src="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-2.jpg" srcset="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_300-2.jpg   300w,&#13;&#10;											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_600-2.jpg   600w,&#13;&#10;											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-2.jpg   1200w,&#13;&#10;											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-2.jpg   2600w" /> &lt;p&gt;The trip started with everyone loading up bikes and gear in my Tahoe at 630 in the morning on 10/1. We drove from Wildwood, MO to Clinton and arrived around 1030am. From there we loaded the gear on to the bikes, and I rode over to the trailhead restroom to throw on my riding clothing. My father in law snapped our photo and we headed out on the trail around 11:10am. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weather on Day 1 was great, though we had a headwind most of the day. It was somewhere between 60 and 70 most of the day and sunny except for when we were under the tree canopy provided throughout the trail.&lt;/p&gt;<img alt="Flat Tube on the Katy Trail" src="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-7.jpg" srcset="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_300-7.jpg   300w,&#13;&#10;											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_600-7.jpg   600w,&#13;&#10;											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-7.jpg   1200w,https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-7.jpg   2600w" /> &lt;p&gt;We made it to the High Point on the trail, 955 feet above sea level, my Garmin showed 935 feet at that point. It didn’t take long before we were stopped on the side of the trail replacing a tube in Luigi’s Trek.&lt;/p&gt;<img alt="Flat Tube on the Katy Trail" src="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-8.jpg" srcset="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_300-8.jpg   300w,&#13;&#10;											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_600-8.jpg   600w,&#13;&#10;											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-8.jpg   1200w,&#13;&#10;											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-8.jpg   2600w" /> &lt;p&gt;After Luigi’s tube, the rest of the day was rather uneventful. Lots of slow climbing up the trail, I forgot how much elevation to expect on the western side of the Katy Trail, total for the day according to my Garmin was 1300 feet of ascent. With the Katy, you’re never going up steep hills, but it is hard some times to tell if you’re flat, downhill, or uphill. MOST of the time it looks like you’re going uphill.<br />&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sedalia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We pulled into Sedalia sometime after 2pm and jumped off the trail east of the bridge that goes over Highway 65. You can cut through a field into a neighborhood that resides behind the various fast food restaurants on 65. We rode for a bit until we got to the area near Burger King so that I could fill my vegan desires with an Impossible Whopper. We couldn’t go inside due to covid, so we rode our bikes through the drive thru and sat down on the curb of a closed business across from BK to eat our food.&lt;/p&gt;<img alt="Sedalia Burger King Drive Thru" src="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-9.jpg" srcset="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_300-9.jpg   300w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_600-9.jpg   600w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-9.jpg   1200w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-9.jpg   2600w" />&lt;p&gt;As we went through Sedalia we expected to come across some of the BAM riders, a group doing a 5 day ride from Defiance to Clinton. We never came across them, though we did see a sign for them directing them off the trail, so we figured they must of made it to their "camp" before we got into town.&lt;/p&gt;<img alt="Sedalia Missouri Trailhead Katy Trail" src="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-11.jpg" srcset="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_300-11.jpg   300w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_600-11.jpg   600w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-11.jpg   1200w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-11.jpg   2600w" />&lt;p&gt;There’s a Katy Trail Detour in Sedalia, basically a section of trail that simply doesn’t exist yet, so you have to head off on some city/country roads to get to the trail again. Going through on a Thursday afternoon, I don’t think we came across a single car while on that section of the ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pilot Grove&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We pulled in to Pilot Grove around 5:30 on Thursday night. We found a local who told us what our food options were in town Deon’s Bar and the Casey’s Gas Station. I called the local police number to tell them we were going to stay the night in the park, they asked for contact info, how many were in our party, and how many tents/hammocks and what color tent. There was no charge to stay in the park for the night.&lt;/p&gt; <img alt="Pilot Grove City Park Katy Trail" src="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-16.jpg" srcset="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_300-16.jpg   300w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_600-16.jpg   600w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-16.jpg   1200w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-16.jpg   2600w" />&lt;p&gt;We headed over to the park, setup the gear for sleeping, and got changed to grab a bite to eat. We headed back to the trailhead where Deon’s was located and locked our bikes up outside to grab a bite to eat. I think I ate a small salad and tater tots for dinner that night, along with a Coke (mistake due to the caffeine). Deon’s was nice enough, mid-Missouri bar, so, smoking occurring inside and Adam’s Family on an old rear projection TV. It is also a package liquor store, so I looked to see if they had anything I wanted to try to haul on my bike for 3 days, fortunately I didn’t find anything I needed.&lt;/p&gt;<img alt="Inverted Niner RLT" src="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-17.jpg" srcset="https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_300-17.jpg   300w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_600-17.jpg   600w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020_1200-17.jpg   1200w,											https://www.bicycletips.com/portals/18/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-17.jpg   2600w" />&lt;p&gt;From there we stopped at Casey’s, I picked up 2 packs of brown sugar cinnamon Pop-Tarts and then we headed back to the camp. My bike had managed to flip itself over a wall while I was inside, fortunately no damage was incurred with that incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chilly Night&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to get rather cold that night, so we were concerned about how warm we would be in our hammocks. I had my rain tarp down low, trying to keep it close to where the hammock was to try and keep some warmth inside my space. I had a sleeping pad, sleeping bag, and an insert for the sleeping bag for extra warmth. I ended up not having the sleeping back zipped up all the way most of the night. I was uncomfortable all night, but not from the cold, I just simply couldn’t get into a position that worked for me in the hammock and had a horrible night of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that Luigi also had the same problem, because I could hear him moving around throughout the night as I lay awake. He unfortunately also had the discomfort of being cold as well. His sleeping pad didn’t provide near the insulation that mine did, and his body isn’t as well insulated as mine either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wagner slept in his tent, and while chilly, I think he actually got a comfortable sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Day 2 – Friday 75.41 Miles Pilot Grove to Tebbetts (<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/4142810405" target="_blank">Strava Ride</a>)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set our alarms for 6am on Friday and got up well before the sunrise to start packing up all our gear and load the bikes back up. We left the park around 7:15am and headed over to Casey’s to grab some breakfast and a coffee, only to find that it was "closed for cleaning"… Thanks covid.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
