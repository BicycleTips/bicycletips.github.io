									<p>
										Where to start? I don’t even know where to start… Let’s
										start back in January. On January 8th, I, Hammond, got let
										go from my VP of Product Management role with a SaaS company
										here in St. Louis that built and managed software for the
										fitness industry. At this time, I was personally ready for
										the change in career, and was setup to be able to not need
										to find a job quickly. I took this opportunity to try to
										make some changes in my life, one of those changes was to
										start riding the trainer in prep for The Mid South, the
										other was to change my diet to a full vegan diet, with whole
										plant based non-processed foods.
									</p>

									<p>
										In the month of January was able to get some good training
										in, 278 miles either on the trainer, or outside on the bike.
										Starting in February though, my training dropped off, I only
										got 155 miles in, with the first training ride being the
										10th of the month. On the 16th of the month, I rode the
										<a

											target="_blank"
											>2020 Prairie Roubaix 100k Rural Assault Ride</a
										>
										in St. James, MO.
									</p>

									<p>
										As the early weeks of March came to be, the world started to
										buzz about the coronavirus, and the week before The Mid
										South, news started talking about the risk of the virus. As
										the week progressed, things started to change quickly,
										emails from The Mid South said that they would not be
										cancelling, and the ride would continue, but offering up
										“deferrals” to riders who wanted to defer to ride in 2021
										instead of 2020 (having to pay the entry cost again though).
										We left for Stillwater Oklahoma from St. Louis the morning
										of Friday the 13th, and on the way down listened to
										President Trump address the nation. We honestly thought they
										were going to shut the country down, and we would simply
										turn around and drive the 6 hours back.
									</p>
									<h2>The President Speaks</h2>
									<p>
										None of that came to fruition, and we made it to Stillwater
										mid-afternoon. We checked in for the ride, walked around the
										expo. The Expo was fairly well spread out, but it was windy,
										so the vendors were having to battle gusts trying to take
										down their displays and pop up tents. The expo was no where
										near the size of the Dirty Kanza expo in 2019, but I don’t
										know how much of that is just the size of the event or due
										to changes with Coronavirus.
									</p>

									<p>
										After perusing the expo we decided to take a drive out of
										town and check out what the surface we would be riding the
										following day looked like. It was shortly after 5pm. We
										drove about 6 miles of the route, and we were pleased, the
										roads were dry as a bone. We took a photo or two, and then
										went to check in to our hotel. We didn’t eat dinner, because
										we were short on time, and wanted to be at the rider’s
										meeting at 7pm, and figured it would be done by 730 and we’d
										head out to grab a bite.
									</p>

									<p>
										By the time we arrived back to the street outside of
										District Bicycles, just before 7, it was raining and very
										cold. We stood around in the rain, fortunately with
										umbrellas, but social distancing ourselves from other
										attendees. There was a band on the stage when we arrived, we
										figured they must be running long and the rider’s meeting
										would happen after they played. Long story short, it was
										8:20pm or so before the guy (Bobby) who was going to conduct
										the meeting was up on stage. He was setting up with ANOTHER
										band. Did I mention it was raining now? Those dry roads at
										6pm, were getting drenched, and it was COLD (low 30s), and
										we were getting very hangry. After the band started playing,
										with no rider’s meeting announcements having occurred, we
										took off, it was time to eat, warm up, dry off, and get some
										sleep.
									</p>

									<p>
										For dinner we headed over to Elm Ave, to check out The
										Garage Burgers &amp; Beer. I found an impossible burger that
										worked to fit my diet while the other Chris(es) found
										burgers to fit their needs. The Garage is right across the
										street from Eskimo Joes, which Wagner was enamored by, due
										to it’s “fame”. I’ll be honest, I’m not sure I had ever
										heard of Eskimo Joes, but he claimed it to be famous and
										pointed out that they were known for T-Shirts. We thought it
										was an ice cream bar, so we figured we might give it a try
										on Saturday night (more on that later).
									</p>
									<h2>Up and At ‘em</h2>
									<p>
										Saturday morning we got up early to find that the Hampton
										Inn was FULL of Mid South riders, and the breakfast
										offerings were slim due to the demand of everyone up at 6am
										trying to get out the door. I had brought my own oatmeal
										along, so I fixed that while Wagner got in line to grab
										something from breakfast choices. The hotel went out of
										their way to try to make the best of things, so they were
										restocking as fast as they could.
									</p>

									<p>
										We then headed to downtown Stillwater to get ourselves ready
										for the ride. We found a good parking spot, right near where
										we had parked the previous day, and sat in the Tahoe for a
										few minutes. It was pouring rain, and there was plenty of
										standing water and even streams running down the streets. It
										had been raining all night, with signs of letting up LATE
										morning. Things were not looking good. The ride was supposed
										to start at 8am, but around 730am or so they announced that
										they were pushing the start back to 830. Took our time
										getting things ready, I ran off to the port-a-lou and tried
										to make my day a little more comfortable.
									</p>

									<p>
										On the way back to the Tahoe I stepped in a big old puddle,
										completely soaking my shoe/foot. That prompted me to change
										socks before we even started riding. About 815 we made our
										way over to the starting area, it was packed. The night
										before we had seen maybe 100 people standing around for the
										rider’s meeting, that led me to believe that the ride would
										be small and attendance had been damped drastically by
										#Covid19. I was mistaken. There were probably two thousand
										people waiting to get started, and a few hundred townsfolk
										there to see us all off. There was no social distancing this
										morning, it was cold, it was pouring rain, and we were
										packed together.
									</p>
									<h2>Heading Out</h2>
									<p>
										About 8:36am I think I crossed the line and headed out on to
										the course. The route started with (if I recall correctly) 2
										miles of paved roads, and then quickly turned into MUCK. The
										very roads we drove the night before, that were pristine and
										perfect, were now a sloppy mess. And it only got worse from
										there. I really wish I could have seen what things looked
										like for the riders at the front of the group, but I am not
										anywhere near a rider of that caliber so we got to see the
										course after 1k other people rode through it first.
									</p>

									<p>
										We made it to Mile 12 (at right about 1 hour into our ride)
										and decided that it was a good place to stop to refill, and
										empty the bladder. With the conditions, it was discussed
										that there would be no refueling while riding, you simply
										had to maintain control of your bike at all times, there was
										no down time to try to grab something to eat, or to try to
										take a drink, even from a Camelbak. While stopped, a young
										lady pulled up and grabbed her phone, she immediately called
										the SAG line and asked for a ride back, she was done. I
										honestly can’t blame her, she said it was her first 100 mile
										bike race, and there was no way she was prepped for these
										conditions. I had wished she had gone further, but she was
										probably one of the smarter folks to actually started the
										ride. The SMARTEST people were likely the ones who didn’t
										even start at all.
									</p>

									<p>
										One thing I quickly figured out, nothing was going to stay
										clean on this ride, including my phone. So you’ll see only a
										few photos in the gallery above. I had intended to take more
										photos, but it simply didn’t happen, and the ones I did take
										were often smudged with mud.
									</p>

									<p>
										I can’t even begin to describe the mud. Oklahoma is known
										for red clay, and these roads, with 1k+ riders were TORE up.
										The mud was 5-6” deep at times. It got on everything. If you
										couldn’t keep pedaling, and had to walk, your bike quickly
										added weight. That weight came in the form of red clay, and
										frequently got so bad that it acted like brakes being
										applied, the mud would pule up in the fork and the tire
										would continue to throw mud into that fork causing
										everything to come to a halt.
									</p>

									<p>
										We made it to around Mile 14 where the first closed
										road/bridge crossing was, the bridge was passable, but you
										had to get off your bike and haul it up and over concrete
										put in place to keep vehicles off both sides of the bridge.
										The further we went along, the worse the roads got. At a
										couple of points we came across 50 mile course diversions,
										and at one point we stopped to discuss whether we should
										abandon the 100 mile route and jump on the 50 mile route. We
										continued to truck on with the 100 mile route however.
									</p>
									<h2>Some Of The Conditions</h2>
									<p>
										As the roads got worse, people were walking through the
										grass on the side of the road, even that surface was soft
										and mushy, and hard to walk on. Early on people started
										having problems with their bikes, ripping off derailleurs,
										losing braking ability, and various other ailments.
									</p>

									<p>
										The surface overall was simply bad. So sloppy and muddy. If
										you could manage to try to ride in someone else’s track you
										might be able to keep your momentum up, but if you got off
										the line (and many places the lines were non-existent) you
										were screwed. I don’t know how many times I yelled “oh shit
										oh shit oh shit” as I was riding along about to completely
										lose it, the brand new (almost) Panaracer Gravel Kings
										barely able to keep the bike upright.
									</p>

									<p>
										Many times going down hills I would pass someone with their
										feet dragging, trying to slow themselves down because there
										brakes were gone. I thought, how is it possible that all
										these people are having braking problems. Well, later I
										would find out. I experienced brake problems of my own.
									</p>
									<h2>Time For A Bath</h2>
									<p>
										At one point, I’m guessing around Mile 37, we came across a
										farm that had a hose out, people were taking the opportunity
										to wash their bikes off. I took the opportunity to rest and
										wait in line to wash my bike off. There were two farm dogs
										hanging out with all their new bicyclist friends, enjoying
										the pets that came as people waited for the hose. Not 5
										minutes later my bike was completely covered again as if I
										hadn’t wasted 15 minutes waiting in line to wash it.
									</p>

									<p>
										As we were going up a hill not too far after this farm, I
										saw a truck at the top of the hill, it was pointing towards
										us, and I secretly, almost audibly, hoped it was a shuttle
										bus and would offer us a ride home. It was not, it was some
										sort of milk/tanker truck, slowly making his way down a
										really nasty part of road, that on an average day was likely
										okay, but today was sketchy at best. (More on him later.)
									</p>

									<p>
										After about 5 hours we had gone a total of 38 miles,
										averaging less than 8 miles an hour. We came to a paved
										road, one of the few that we’d seen up to this point, maybe
										the first since we touched dirt. We were heading west
										towards Perkins, OK. The road ran North/South, and would
										take us back towards Stillwater and other paved roads. If we
										decided we wanted out, it would be the path of least
										resistance for returning to the start. The three of us
										talked about it, and Lybarger decided he was going to keep
										going, so off he went. Wagner and I were discussing what to
										do, thinking we were going to try to keep going to Perkins.
										Next thing you know a red Chevy Colorado pulls up and asks
										us if we want a ride back to Stillwater. Yes, sold, take us
										home. We were done, and this opportunity provided us our
										out. We shouted to Lybarger who came back to us for a
										discussion. The truck could take 3 bikes, and 3 riders, but
										Lybarger decided he as going to keep going.
									</p>
									<h2>Abandoned</h2>
									<p>
										Wagner and I loaded up, and spent the next 30 minutes riding
										around with two guys from Colorado who were looking to fill
										the extra spot on the bike rack before taking us back up to
										Stillwater, which would be about a 30 minute drive. Come to
										find out that the gentleman who picked us up was
										<a
											href="https://www.usacycling.org/about-us/team"
											target="_blank"
											>Chuck Hodge, the Chief of Racing and Events for USA
											Cycling</a
										>. He spoke about how pretty much every other USA Cycling
										event for the next 5-6 weeks was being cancelled, or had
										already been cancelled, and this was likely the last for
										quite some time.
									</p>

									<p>
										We came across a few riders who could use a ride, but none
										chose to do so. One guy had just recently gone head first
										over his handlebars and cut his chin. Chuck got of the
										truck, grabbed a first aid kit cut, cleaned him up, and
										offered him a ride. He chose to continue. Another gentleman
										that we had passed while riding, was walking his bike west.
										He had broken his bike, but he already had someone coming to
										pick him up, so he kept going towards the road ahead.
									</p>
									<h2>Nope That’s Not It</h2>
									<p>
										We turned north (we had been heading east backtracking on
										the course), asking riders if they wanted help, and came
										across a lady stopped in the middle of the road to refuel.
										She was in the middle of nowhere, in fact, she was not even
										on the course, she had missed a turn. We informed her of
										this, and she questioned our sanity. She couldn’t believe
										she was in the wrong. We told her how to easily get back on
										course, she wasn’t far from the actual course. She was
										offered a ride, an out, but she chose to keep riding. We end
										up coming back towards the course and were going to drive
										back out the road we had come east on, towards the paved
										road where we were picked up, when we could see the Milk
										Truck off in the distance.
									</p>

									<p>
										It was climbing the hill, or attempting to, that it had been
										coming down when we passed it about an hour earlier, it was
										now stuck. It did not appear that it was going to make it up
										that hill, and there was no way that we believed we could
										get the Chevy Colorado around it due to the way it was
										lodged in the road. Chuck called this in on race radio to
										let organizers know, and we headed south to try to find
										another way around and back to the course.
									</p>

									<p>
										At the location where Chuck had picked us up, we came across
										another rider, from Kansas, who had walked 2 miles back, to
										get to that point. He had ripped his derailleur off, and
										needed a ride back. Golden, we had our 3 bikes, 3 riders,
										and a ride back to Stillwater. Chuck end up dropping Wagner
										and the other rider off at our hotel. The idea being that
										Wagner could work on cleaning his bike (the hotel had a hose
										out front for this purpose) and I could head back to the
										Tahoe. I figured I was going to need to drive to Perkins in
										the Tahoe to get Lybarger. Chuck dropped me off near the
										finish line and I grabbed my bike, and backpack (but not my
										helmet) from the back of his truck, along with a selfie. I
										went over to the Tahoe to get my bike loaded up and a
										somewhat clean change of clothes put on.
									</p>

									<p>
										I was right about Lybarger, he had spent the 2 hours since
										we split from him, riding 12 miles into Perkins. They had
										closed up the aid station and most people were trying to
										find rides back to Stillwater. On my way down to Perkins I
										passed probably 30 riders who were all heading north towards
										Stillwater, riders who had chosen to abandon the ride and
										take paved roads back to civilization.
									</p>

									<p>
										I dropped Lybarger off at his hotel and headed over to my
										hotel to try to get my bike, and myself cleaned up. That
										evening we headed back downtown and hung out around the
										finish line for a bit. We grabbed some additional swag (one
										thing about The Mid South, they had a ton of swag, and with
										the lowered attendance due to coronavirus, there was plenty
										of extra).
									</p>
									<h2>Dinner With Joe</h2>
									<p>
										We then headed back to Elm Ave to visit Eskimo Joes for
										dinner. It ends up Eskimo Joes is bar and grill, a very
										large one, with a huge merchandise store, with hundreds of
										Eskimo Joe apparel items, and while they might sell some ice
										cream for desert, they are not an ice cream shop. They
										started out as a bar in the 70s, and added food after the
										drinking age was changed from 18 to 21. The food was okay,
										nothing fancy for my vegan palate. I had another impossible
										burger to continue to stick to my vegan diet, that was
										pretty much the only thing on the menu that would fit that
										requirement. I ended up picking up a couple of shirts,
										<a href="https://eskimojoes.com/faqs/" target="_blank"
											>since EJ’s is apparently known for their T-Shirts</a
										>.
									</p>

									<p>
										Sunday morning we loaded up the Tahoe, grabbed some
										breakfast at the Hampton Inn and hit the road for the 6.5
										hour drive back to St. Louis. We stopped in Springfield MO
										for lunch, and picked up a few grocery items as we were
										hearing that more and more things were becoming scarce in
										St. Louis. We drove through Rolla and I pointed out a few of
										my old college haunts to Wagner.
									</p>
									<h2>The Mid Summary</h2>
									<p>
										While initially we were disappointed that we abandoned the
										ride, we were not the only ones, there were hundreds, I
										imagine (wild ass guess) over 50%, probably close to 75%, of
										the entrants who entered, abandoned. The conditions were
										that brutal. That being said, while we were riding, besides
										the mental breaking down that the mud caused, we had a
										blast. Everyone was friendly and muddy together.
									</p>

									<p>
										Even with the lower attendance, and the much smaller
										festivities in town, and the very very very poor route
										conditions, no regrets were had for attending and attempting
										to ride the ride. The only thing I think we would have
										changed, we would have early on decided to do the 50 mile
										route, and attempted to complete that. 100 Miles simply
										wasn’t going to happen for us on the 14th of March 2020.
										Averaging less than 8 miles an hour for 5 hours was not
										going to get us to 100 miles.
									</p>
									<h2>The Aftermath</h2>
									<p>
										While we had fun, and we made our bikes dirty, we also did
										some damage. While nothing “broke” during the ride, that I
										knew of, my brake pads (new in January) were shot and needed
										replaced. I also had to replace my bottom bracket, my rear
										shift/brake lever and complete replacement of all cables.
										Ultimately I had about $500 in repairs/parts completed on my
										bike as a result of The Mid South, so it was an expensive 38
										mile Saturday bike ride...
									</p>

									<p>
										Would we recommend it in 2021? If you can get in,
										absolutely. But if there is any rain, or it rains for 16
										hours straight starting at 6pm on Friday night before the
										ride, go into it with gear that you don’t mind just
										completely trashing, or stay in your hotel and sleep
										instead.
