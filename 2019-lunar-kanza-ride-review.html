										A few months late, but here it goes! Back in July, I headed
										out to Emporia again, this time with my buddy Wagner. We
										planned for a few weeks to hit up the Lunar Kanza, with the
										intention of 1) trying to secure a lotto bypass for Dirty
										Kanza 2020, and 2) having fun. In that order.
									</p>

									<p>
										Lunar Kanza is a casual ride that they organize close to a
										full moon, that happens in evening/early part of the night,
										this time it was in July, about 6 weeks after DK. There was
										a 50 mile option, the maximum length, that is what we
										planned to complete. Part of the draw for LK is that it is a
										little more fun, a little more casual, and there are
										opportunities to get &ldquo;tokens&rdquo; out on the course,
										that you can trade in for prizes after the ride. The tokens
										are spread throughout the course in unknown locations. The
										prizes for the tokens vary, from small, cheap things, to
										large expensive things such as a Lauf Fork, or a bypass on
										the Dirty Kanza Lottery for 2020.
									</p>

									<p>
										Wagner and I left St Louis at a decent time of morning on
										Saturday, planning for about a 4.5 hour drive, with a 6pm
										start time, we weren&rsquo;t in a super rush to get there,
										and not in a super rush to get up and miss out on valuable
										sleep before we hit the road. We had booked a room at the
										Super 8 in Emporia, the same hotel that I stayed at for the
										DK in June.
									</p>

									<p>
										We got into Emporia around 3pm and walked around town a
										little bit. For Lunar Kanza there is far less setup, only a
										couple of vendors, and way less people crowding out this
										small town. So we got a chance to walk around a see a bit
										more than I did a few weeks earlier. We got checked in at
										registration for the ride at the Gravel City location, and
										then wandered a bit.
									</p>

										>After checking out a few sites we headed to the hotel to
										get our things settled there before the start of the event.
										This was mid-July in the Midwest, so Emporia was a little
										warm that day, our hope was that it would cool off as the
										sun went down. By the time we made it back to where the
										event was starting, it definitely had not cooled off, but a
										crowd had started to gather. We parked in the same parking
										lot I parked in in June, with nice easy access to where we
										needed to be for the start of the ride. We prepped the
										bikes, prepped ourselves, and got everything in order for 50
										miles of Kansas gravel.

										>The start of the Lunar Kanza goes north on Mechanics street
										and followed the same route as the 2019 DK, at least for the
										first few miles. We ended up crossing over the freeway and
										turning down the same gravel road we did in June. It was at
										this point that we saw our first token. We were so wrapped
										up in the ride that we didn&rsquo;t even realize what it
										was. Shortly after that was saw a couple on a tandem
										stopped, the lady was running back towards the token.
									</p>

									<p>
										This was ultimately the ONLY token we saw while riding the
										whole day. We were towards the back of the group, and we
										believe that this ultimately caused us to simply not see any
										tokens on the road, because other people found them and
										picked them up. We did see two other riders getting tokens
										while we were riding, but we considered those tokens already
										gone as we weren&rsquo;t able to have a chance at getting
										them.
									</p>

									<p>
										The LK route went north, then west through Americus and out
										towards the reservoir. We figured/assumed, that this would
										be a rest stop, as it was at the half way point for the
										ride, but in the weeks leading up to the ride information
										became sketchy as to whether or not there would be a rest
										stop there. We wouldn&rsquo;t know till we arrived, if there
										was or not.
									</p>

									<p>
										Originally Wagner and I stayed together, but at some point
										we got separated. If I recall correctly, I got ahead of him
										for a bit of time, he ended up catching me, and then passing
										me as I slowly ran out of juice on the day. I decided I was
										going to take my time, these long gravel rides tend to be a
										lonely type of suffering ride, so he rode on ahead and we
										met back up at the rest stop. Kansas gravel really is
										beautiful, and I got to see some amazing sites while out
										there riding. At some point before we got separated the
										first time, we saw a guy go down in some rutted roads. We
										managed to avoid the carnage and keep going.
									</p>

									<p>
										At one point on the ride there was a group of locals out
										partying in an above ground pool, they had some LK riders
										over and they were jumping in, full bike kits, for a cooling
										dip. I&rsquo;m sure the water felt great, but I wasn&rsquo;t
										about to stop and soak myself from head to toe.
										<a
											href="https://www.facebook.com/BicycleTips/videos/492430181321338/"
											target="_blank"
											>I did get a shot of the pool from my GoPro Fusion,
											it&rsquo;s posted on Facebook</a
										>.
									</p>

									<p>
										At the rest stop I met up with Wagner again, and we
										refueled. The problem with the rest stop, it was at the
										bottom of
										<a
											href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2530041895/segments/63603460017"
											target="_blank"
											>Kahola Hill</a
										>, so you had an opportunity to fill up on food, and then go
										out on the toughest climb of the ride. I paid for that,
										filling up on food was not a good idea. The hill hurt.
										Wagner got ahead of me and I was in for the lonely ride back
										to Americus. By this point the sun was starting to go down a
										bit, but it was far from dark.
									</p>

									<p>
										As the sun was going down I was able to get some fairly cool
										shots, if i do say so myself, with my phone. Some days I
										wish I rode with my DSLR, but most days I don&rsquo;t have
										any desire to carry that around. At one point you could see
										smoke on the horizon, and the closer you got the
										thicker/darker it got. Ended up being what looked to be a
										bunch of junk, maybe even an old trailer home, being burned.
										I&rsquo;m not sure if the timing of this burn was meant to
										coincide with the Lunar Kanza, but the smell/smoke
										definitely wasn&rsquo;t appreciated. Here are some of those
										photos:
									</p>

									<p>
										As the sun was going down I decided it was time to turn my
										lights on. By this point I was stopping to rest as I was
										feeling pretty tired. As I rolled into Americus I found
										Wagner at the rest stop waiting for me. I wanted to grab
										some water while there, and check the stop out. As I was
										doing so, I saw some of the volunteers filling up balloons,
										that had lights in them. I immediately thought that they
										were likely putting some tokens together, so I called Wagner
										over. I figured they were going to have multiple tokens, and
										we could each get one.
									</p>

									<p>
										We then realized that they were tying the balloons together,
										and that there likely was going to only be one token
										available. I then spent the next ten minutes trying to look
										inconspicuous. Eventually I saw one of the ladies head
										around behind the restroom there at the stop, she tied the
										balloons to one of the bike racks way in the back that no
										one was using. I immediately went over and untied the
										balloons. She asked if I knew what to do, I said yeah, take
										them with me. She said to make sure that they all made it
										back to Emporia. The token was 4 or 5 balloons, with
										ribbons, tied to a plastic ring, and a white tag with a
										number on it. I came prepared, I had zip ties in my
										backpack, so I went over to the bike and started attaching
										the balloons to my backpack. The zip ties I brought came in
										super handy, along with the backpack, it was going to be
										fairly easy to get the balloons back! Here&rsquo;s what my
										bike and backpack looked like as we headed out of Americus.

									<p>
										The ride the rest of the way was uneventful. It was
										definitely dark now, and the nightrider lights I had
										borrowed from
										<a href="https://www.2timingguys.com/" target="_blank"
											>Matt Struckman of 2TimingGuys.com</a
										>, were excellent. I think I had a 1000 lumen light on the
										bike, and 750 on my head. Along with a nightrider tail
										light, and some colored lights off my kids bikes I was easy
										to spot on the road. Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget the
										balloons!
									</p>

									<p>
										We were on the lookout for the ruts in the road that had
										taken down the guy on the way north, but somehow we never
										came across them. I&rsquo;m still not sure how that is
										possible, we were heading back down the same road we went
										out on, but we never could find it. We rode into town, down
										mechanics street and into the finish area. The band was just
										finishing up, and starting to tear things down, so we headed
										to our car to ditch the bikes and some of our gear before we
										header over to trade my balloons/token in, and get some
										food. We ended up at the prize table and I was told I needed
										my number off my bike to claim my prize, but I was told that
										my prize was GOLDEN TICKET!
									</p>

									<p>
										What does golden ticket get you? Why, it gets you a bypass
										of the Lottery for the Dirty Kanza 2020! I was stoked to say
										the least. I wanted to quickly get back to get my number to
										make sure I didn&rsquo;t miss out on this! I rushed back to
										the car and back to the prize table to get my ticket. The
										lady tried to take my backpack from me, at which point I
										told her that wasn&rsquo;t the token, the backpack was mine,
										so she let me keep the balloons (minus the one she popped).
									</p>

									</p>

									<p>
										From there Wagner and I grabbed some food, and a drink. We
										sat down to eat and my balloons started popping on the
										ground. We didn&rsquo;t stick around too long, with the band
										having torn down, we ate and decided we would simply get
										back to the hotel and get some sleep so we could drive home
										at a decent hour the next day.
									</p>

									<p>
										The ride back to St. Louis was uneventful, except for
										stopping in Columbia, Missouri, where Wagner introduced me
										to Shakespeare&rsquo;s Pizza. It was excellent, and I even
										stopped there a week later with my kids when we went through
										Columbia to visit family on the other side of Missouri.
									</p>

									<p>
										If you haven&rsquo;t done the Dirty Kanza, or even if you
										have, be sure to check out Lunar Kanza assuming they do it
										again next year. I&rsquo;ll be out there if I can,
