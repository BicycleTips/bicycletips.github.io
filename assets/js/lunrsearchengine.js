    "title": "",
    "body": "2025/01/15 -  For 2011 I personally set 3 goals, you can read about them fully on my post from 1/1/2011. Basically they were to lose 30 lbs (goal weight of 255, I'm a big guy), inline skate 100 miles (I do like me some skating, I'm a freak I know this) and ride a bike 500 miles. At the beginning of 2011 the bike I had was a 2004 Diamondback XTS Moto, not exactly something you could see yourself riding 500 miles on (at least not me). So in June I picked up a Cannondale Quick CX 1 and began my journey. As I posted back in November, I met the goal of riding 500 miles on the bike, and I fully intended to hit the skating goal of 100 miles. I am sad to say however, that I didn't skate 100 miles, and I didn't lose 30lbs last year, more like 7lbs. The weight was a rather lofty goal, but skating was definitely doable. I did manage to skate ~55 miles, but I really fell in love with cycling last year, so the skating definitely fell by the way side. My final bicycling total for 2011 was 572. 36 miles, and while looking at other people's riding numbers, it isn't much, it was a great achievement for me, and hopefully a great start to many years of riding. For 2012 I am setting some new goals, but this time I am not going to say  I want to lost the remaining 23lbs (I did lose/keep off 7lbs in 2011). I am not going to set any inline skating goals, while I hope to still skate some in 2012. I am also not going to set an official mileage goal, though I would think that 12-1500 should be doable with the other goals listed below. I am going to set the following goals, and hopefully they will help me towards getting in shape and losing weight, the weight is not the focus. With all of the following goals, I would hope that I can find some friends, or make some new ones, that want to participate with me. If so, please use the Contact form on the About page.  LiveSTRONG Challenge Davis Century Ride, Davis, CA, June 2012 (link) My primary goal is to participate in the LiveSTRONG Challenge in Davis California on June 24, 2012. I am planning to attempt the 100 mile ride that hot day in June, in order to do this, I have a lot of training to do. As part of the LiveSTRONG Challenge I am working to raise money to raise awareness and fight cancer, it hit close to home in 2011 as my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer. You can donate to my fund raising at https://laf. livestrong. org/goto/chrishammond I appreciate any and all donations, no matter how large or small! If you are interested in riding with me (please do) you can join Team DotNetNuke for the challenge, even if you don't want to ride the 100 mile ride, you can do a shorter distance as part of the challenge. Wine Country Metric Century, Santa Rosa, CA May 2012 (link) In May of 2012 I plan to partake tin the Wine Country Century (metric) put on by the Santa Rosa Cycling Club. I hope that this will be right in line with my LiveSTRONG training, 62 miles on a Saturday in early May. Registration for this opens in February 2012, so hopefully I can get in as there is a limit to the number of registrants. Tierra Bella 2012 60k, Gilroy, CA April 2012 (link) As prep for the above to events I hope to take part in the 60k route of the 2012 Tierra Bella bike ride put on by the Almaden Cycle Touring Club near Gilroy California. This will be around 35 miles. Registration is open, though I haven't yet registered as I am waiting to see if my wife is going to participate in this as well. Marin Triathlon (sprint), Marin County, CA, November 2012 (link) To close out the year, I am planning to participate in my first triathlon. I'm not a runner, not really a fan of it, I used to swim a lot as a kid, so I am hoping that with the riding to get ready for the LiveSTRONG Challenge I will manage to get in shape enough that I can take part in and complete my first sprint triathlon. My wife is also likely going to do this one as well. Following my goals? Well, you can follow my rides and stats by checking out my Strava. com profile. I'll be doing another writeup here in the next week on strava. com and why I think it is the best website for tracking rides, and even finding new ones. I just signed up for it about a week ago, and I am totally addicted to it now. Stay tuned for that post. "

    "body": "2024/05/28 - I won’t be at Unbound Gravel this year (I’ve been on the bike all of 2 times since December 31st) but I am getting the itch to be in Emporia Kansas this week, it’s Unbound time! If this is your first time to Emporia, here’s a little bit of what you can expect based on my previous visits.  Get there early! You’re going to want time to do some of the things below.  Get out on group rides! There are plenty of group rides going on this week. Join a couple of them. Most of them are not long/complex rides, but can be a good intro to some of the course that you’ll see in the 50/100/200 mile rides on Saturday. You might also get some sponsor swag at their organized group rides too.      No you don’t need to actually be entered into Unbound Gravel to enter some of these group rides! Check with organizers to be sure.     Lots of sponsor swag! Keep on the look out if you like collecting things. Anyone want to see my bandana collection from DK/Unbound? I don’t even know what to do with them all.  EXPO, this is the big one. The All Things Gravel Expo is a must see event! It has limited hours, only on Thursday and Friday, you won’t find it on Saturday or Sunday!     Thursday, May 30, 2024  2:00 PM – 7:00 PM   Friday, May 31, 2024   10:00 AM – 5:00 PM Definitely get out there and check if out. If you like swag this is the place to be. You can find t-shirts, bottles, food samples, bandanas and who knows what else as giveaways, and you can purchase even more!    Some of the Emporia local shops are great, check them out! Also be sure to check out Daylight Donuts if they are still open, holy flaky goodness. Merchant Cycles is absolutely worth a stop as well.  Be sure to attend/watch the rider’s meeting for important info.  Check in early to get everything you need for your ride, and make sure you’ve got a plan for where/how you are meeting your support crew! YOU NEED A SUPPORT CREW and a PLAN. After your finish your ride you’re going to want to take part in the bike washing stations! Take care of yourselves out there, be preapred, be ready for anything, and most of all, just enjoy the week! You’re in for it! I hope to see you out there again next year. "

    "body": "2024/01/01 - So here we are, another year later. 2023 wasn’t much in terms of riding, but I’ll get to that in a bit. 2023 was quite the adventure from a family perspective. Both my parents were in memory care most of the year, fortunately in apartments side by side. In early summer my father really started struggling, had a couple of falls and spent time in the ER and hospital recovering. By the end of summer he had another couple of falls and ultimately a stroke took him from us. Overall the family held up well during this time, but it was not without stress and struggle to get through most of the year. I haven’t actually ridden my bike since September 17th. At that point I still had plans to ride Big Sugar Gravel in Bentonville Arkansas a month later. That didn’t happen, along with Unbound Gravel, I managed to not make either of the scheduled rides I had for the year. So what did get accomplished on the bike this year? Almost 50% less riding than 2022, and only 1/4 of the riding from 2020! Here’s a simple breakdown. 2023 Bike Riding Stats: 37 Rides507. 5 Miles8,790’ of elevation42 hours So overall, a pretty down year! But 2024 will be different! I hope. I’ve only got one scheduled ride so far this year, but it’s another big one, 100 miles at Unbound Gravel in June. How am I going to ensure I get to participate this year? Well, hopefully my riding buddies will help me be accountable! Wigs and Wags are both planning on being there, though Wags will be there as our support crew. Hope to see you out on the bike! "

    "title": "Bicycle Maintenance Tips and Instructions",
    "body": "2023/01/30 - Bike Maintenance Instructions:  Cleaning:     Regular cleaning is an essential part of bike maintenance. Before performing any maintenance, you should start by cleaning the bike frame, chain, gears, and other parts.    To clean the bike, you’ll need a degreaser and a soft cloth. Apply the degreaser to the areas that need cleaning, such as the chain, gears, and frame, and scrub gently with the cloth.    This will help remove grime and dirt that can build up over time. Once you’ve finished cleaning, rinse the bike with water to remove any leftover degreaser.     Lubrication:     After cleaning, you should lubricate the chain and gears.    A good lubricant will help protect the metal parts from rust and corrosion, and it will also make the bike run more smoothly.    Apply a few drops of lubricant to the chain, and then use a clean cloth to spread it evenly. Be sure to lubricate the gears as well, especially those that are exposed to the elements.     Tires:     Check the tires for proper pressure and inspect them for damage or wear.    If you’re using a road bike, you should aim for a pressure of around 100-130 psi, while mountain bikes typically require a lower pressure of around 30-50 psi.    If the pressure is too low, use a pump to fill the tires to the correct level.    Check the tires for cuts, punctures, or other signs of damage, and replace the tire if necessary.     Brakes:     Check the brake pads for wear and adjust if needed.    If the brake pads are worn down to the metal, they will need to be replaced.    Check the brake cables as well, and make sure they are tightened properly.    If the brakes are not functioning properly, you may need to take the bike to a professional mechanic for a more in-depth inspection.     Drivetrain:     Check the tightness of the bolts on the crank arm, pedals, and bottom bracket, and tighten any that are loose.    Check the gears to make sure they are shifting smoothly.    If the gears are not shifting properly, you may need to adjust the derailleur.     Steering:     Check the tightness of the stem bolts, headset, and handlebar, and tighten any that are loose.    Make sure the handlebars are positioned correctly, and that the bike is easy to steer.    If the steering feels loose or wobbly, you may need to take the bike to a professional mechanic for further inspection.     Suspension:     If your bike has suspension, it’s important to check it regularly to make sure it’s functioning properly.    Check for proper suspension function and adjust accordingly.    If the suspension feels stiff or bouncy, you may need to make some adjustments.     Wheel true:     Ensure that the wheels spin straight and true.    If the wheels are not true, you may need to make some adjustments to keep the bike riding smoothly.     Chain wear:     Over time, the chain will start to wear down and stretch.    To check for chain wear, use a chain wear indicator tool.    If the chain is worn, it will need to be replaced to avoid damage to the gears.    A worn chain will cause shifting problems, so it’s important to replace it promptly.     Final Inspection:     After performing all the above checks and maintenance, give the bike a final inspection.    Test ride the bike to ensure it is running smoothly and everything is functioning properly.    Check the brakes, gears, and steering, and make any necessary adjustments.    If anything seems out of place, take the bike back to a professional mechanic for further inspection.    Note: Regular maintenance is important to keep your bike running smoothly and to extend its lifespan. If you are unsure about performing any of these maintenance tasks, take the bike to a professional mechanic for assistance. "

    "body": "2022/06/30 - So you’re thinking you might want to go to Unbound Gravel 2023? The lottery won’t open up until January 2023, but if you haven’t booked a hotel already, you’re out of luck. Emporia’s hotels book up really quickly. If you haven’t booked already, you are likely out of luck, but if you follow some of the tips below, we’ll try to help you find a place to stay that doesn’t take you an hour plus of driving each way (Topeka). (6/30/2022) I was able to book a room at a hotel this morning, so there are still some available. So here are the tricks to finding a hotel in Emporia Kansas for Unbound Gravel.  Start early. I start looking at hotel websites the weekend of the current year’s event. Most hotels don’t open up their booking windows that far in advance, but some do, and the rest have them open soon there after.  Look often. Check your hotel websites DAILY, if not morning and evening, to increase your odds of finding when they open up the booking window.  Check all the hotels in Emporia Avoid the Knight’s Inn. People apparently are able to book here, but from what I hear the past two years, it actually doesn’t exist anymore, it isn’t open.  Check again Don’t fret if you don’t find a hotel, keep looking! In January people who don’t make the lottery will start cancelling their bookings.  Look into the college dorms, they typically open up for registration in January or February, but sell out quickly. Their rates include meals as well.  As we get closer to the ride, pay attention to the Unbound Gravel (unofficial) Facebook Group. People often times post there when 9hey are cancelling their rooms.  Look outside of Emporia, get a room that can be cancelled at no charge in case you find something in town.  Keep looking!If you’re diligent, you can almost assuredly get yourself a hotel room in Emporia for Unbound Gravel! "

    "title": "Ordering a bike from Canyon",
    "body": "2022/02/17 - For the past few years I’ve had dreams of buying a new bicycle. I went back and forth on what to get, where to get it, etc. Last year when Canyon announced the Grizl, I knew what I was going to buy. I was a little concerned about purchasing a direct to consumer brand, but after seeing Canyon’s support of the gravel scene last year, and getting some of their swag at Unbound, I decided I felt safe enough. Ordered a Canyon Grizl: It was early/mid December when the bike finally came in stock in my size, so I placed the order. The first two rides were great, I was getting adjusted to the bike, the new shimano components (first time with Shimano components on a bike). On the third ride I noticed that the big ring up front seemed to have issues, like it was deformed/bent. Originally I thought it was just a bent tooth on the ring, I’ve experienced that before, but upon further inspection I wasn’t able to find a single tooth that was off. I was able to see when hand pedalling that the chain looked to shift over when it got to a couple of teeth, causing the bike to feel like it wanted to shift to the smaller ring up front. I was able to ride, but if the rear cassette was in any of the 4 or 5 larger rings, pedalling was inconsitant as it wanted to continually downshift up front. Canyon Grizl with a bent front chain ring: Upon getting home from the ride I inspected further and was able to determine that the main chain ring looks to be misshapen. I ended up calling Canyon’s support number, was told it would likely be under warranty as I hadn’t had the bike for long, and that I needed to go online and submit a support request with photos of the problem.  Canyon Customer Service: So I did that, I went through the process of putting together photos trying to document the problem for them. I uploaded those photos and submitted the form on February 2nd, 2022. I immediately received an email with a case number, and in the email it said something to the effect of “if you don’t hear from us in 12-15 business days, please give us a call”. From a customer service perspective, this is NOT a great first introduction to direct to consumer customer service. Actually, my first experience was calling them and they told me to submit the form, so that was a pretty poor experience initially, followed by an even worse one. So here we are, February 17th, 2022. I went for another ride the other day, the chain ring definiteyl still has problems, making riding in the big ring a chore unless I’m really up to speed, causing me to run the small ring more than I typically would. I called Canyon’s customer support line today, and after waiting on hold for 15 minutes (their call back option wouldn’t take my button press for some reason) I finally spoke with a rep. Great News: He asked me for my case number, read the case, looked at the photos, then informed me that I had a 2 year warranty on components. Bad News: I would have to go direct to Shimano for the warranty work for the chain ring. He provided a phone number I would need to call to open up a support request. 15 days, two weeks, and I had to call Canyon, to be told that I would need to call Shimano to get support instead? Why couldn’t someone at Canyon have told me that two weeks ago? So now I have a call back request in with Shimano. I called them 30 minutes ago. I’ll update this post as I find out how big of an ordeal it is trying to actually get support from a direct to consumer bicycle brand…. Update after response from Shimano: Got a call back from Shimano today. They provided me two options to get the warranty work done. 1) I can go to a local bike shop (assuming they need to sell shimano, but he didn’t say that directly) and they can do the inspection and file the warranty request with Shimano. 2) I can fill out a form on Shimano’s website, then I can mail in the part and have them inspect it and determine if it is under warranty…. So I will lean towards option 1 and hope that Trailhead will help me out on this one. Direct To Consumer Bicycles, is it good for you?: I am not sure…. "

    "title": "How to enter Unbound Gravel for 2022",
    "body": "2022/01/04 - So you think you want to try to take on Unbound Gravel, but you aren’t sure how to get in? Well, to be honest, for 2022, your options are limited. There are two ways available to you right now, one is a “random” draw, and the other requires you to spend some serious moolah ($$$). Gravel Camp: So the “guarantee your entry” way for 2022 is to sign up and attend the Gravel Camp(s). There are actually two options for the Camp, one that includes an entry for 2022 ($2200) and one that doesn’t include entry ($1000). The camp looks to be a 4 day adventure, be sure to check out the Unbound Gravel Camp page for more info. Lottery Entry: If you aren’t interested in spending $2200 and doing the camp, the primary option people use to get into Unbound Gravel is the Lottery. The Lottery is open from January 5th through 18th, and is basically a lotto based system for getting an entry. The demand for entries for Unbound is greater than the number of entrants that the course and stops can support, so the lotto is how they control the registration, trying to make it a little more “fair” for people trying to get in, instead of a land rush type registration. So how does the lottery work?: Basically you sign up for Unbound, you put all the information in as if you were registering, including Payment information. You won’t be charged however until the selection process occurs and you are chosen. If you aren’t picked in the Lotto, you will not be charged. In past years, you could also put in the name of a group that you want to ride with, and if all members of the group don’t make it in, you don’t get charged. This is useful if you want to ensure that you ride with friends, but means that one of you might actually get picked, and not be able to enter because the others in the group didn’t get picked. Sometime in early February they will choose who gets in, notify people, and charged the credit cards. Hotel Info: If you don’t have a hotel reservation already, you should get on that! Last I checked all the hotels are full, but once the lotto selection process occurs you may see some rooms open up. Also in early February the dorms should open up for reservation, that will likely be your best option if you don’t have a room yet. 2023 Entry: Don’t get in for 2022? Start planning for 2023 right now! Volunteer Registration: If you or a loved one put in 10 volunteer hours you can bypass the lotto for 2023! If you don’t get in for 2022, definitely considering volunteering, we did it in 2021 and had a hell of a time! Closing Thoughts: Good luck getting into the event! Hope you do, and if you don’t, you should considering going to Emporia that weekend anyway. There are organized rides before the event, you can get out and see some beautiful Kansas gravel, as well as experience the atmosphere around Unbound all the same! "

    "title": "The 2021 Big and Little Sugar Gravel Ride Review",
    "body": "2021/10/25 - Where to start on this one, it’s been an interesting year, not the best to be honest with a variety of things causing turmoil this year, I question how much I want to, or should share, so we’ll see what comes out in this post. First and foremost, to the family that experienced tragedy this weekend, I am so sorry for your loss. For the rest of the weekend and ride review: Monday morning I texted my buddy Wagner (Wags) to tell him I was out, I would not be going to Bentonville for Big Sugar Gravel. I had spent a few days fighting a sinus infection (I am vaccinated and tested negative for covid, though I was pretty sure before the test that it was a usual for me sinus thing). I had only been on my bike once in October, and was simply not ready to try to ride 100 miles in North West Arkansas and South West Missouri. He let me stew on the message I sent him for a bit then suggested we could still do the 50 mile ride, the Little Sugar. By early afternoon that simple reply from him had flipped my mindset. We went out for a ride that afternoon and I was back in the game, though with an adjusted plan to ride 50 miles and still be back home in St. Louis Saturday night so I could go to my daughter’s gymnastics competition on Sunday. Friday morning we left St. Louis County arriving in Bentonville shortly after 1pm. We went to the 8th Street Market to figure out where Outerbike was, and to grab some lunch before registration was supposed to open. At registration we were easily able to switch our entries from Big Sugar to Little Sugar, and I got a thank you from Treva for letting them know about a bridge that was out on the 100 mile route.  Side Note: So this trip was not my first to Bentonville, I had actually been down there for the first time one week prior, meeting with a potential customer about a software project. On my drive back, last Friday the 15th, I decided to cruise along some of the gravel roads to see what we were in for. I wasn’t more than a mile off the highway when I came across a closed road, which I knew from looking at the Ride With GPS map was part of the route for Big Sugar. I drove down the closed road (don’t try this at home kids) and came across a crew working feverishly on a bridge. Before I got home on Friday I reached out to the LifeTime crew to ask if they knew about the bridge. They reached out on Monday and made sure to get out and check it out. In their defense, they had recently covered the course, but the bridge was damaged sometime after that scouting run.  From there we walked around Outerbike. I must admit, the Dirty Kanza/Unbound Gravel expo puts all other expos at events (besides my one trip to Sea Otter) to shame. I was kind of expecting Outerbike to compete, but it was much smaller. It was most definitely there for the MTB crew, and while the Gravel folks were accepted, the focus was on mountain bikes and demos, primarily. That being said, we picked up a number of swag items, including waffles from both Untapped and Honeystinger. Wags found and geeked out with Jom from GravelCyclist. Another local, Adelmann, from St. Louis showed up at the expo, so we organized a brief afternoon ride. He wanted to check out the beginning of the course, and I was really more interested in trying to see some of Bentonville and some of the trails. Wags and I ended up heading up towards the Slaughter Pen trail, which also happened to be the finish area for both Big and Little Sugar. We headed off into some single track on our gravel steeds and had a blast trying not to injure ourselves before Saturday. From there we headed out the road up and under the highway. We ended up only putting in about 10. 5 miles, but it was enough to get our legs moving a bit and see some of Bentonville. We stopped at the Phat Bike shop and eached picked up a t-shirt, while I picked up some new cleats for my shoes thinking that my old ones were wearing out (they weren’t, the new ones felt just as loose as the old ones).  Saturday morning we checked out of the hotel and headed up to find a parking spot. We ended up parking near the Square in Bentonville, which worked out fricken amazingly. There was a public bathroom right there, and we were 1 block from the finish line so that after the ride we could easily get the bikes back on the rack and we could change clothes. We had hoped to make it to the start line for the 7am Big Sugar start, to see Adelmann off, but ended up not making it down there until closer to 720am.  The start was at the Momentary, which to be honest, is a cool looking building, but I have no idea what it actually is, the assumption is it is some sort of art space. (Runs off to google: The Momentary brings together contemporary visual, performing, and culinary arts into a welcoming, communal space in Northwest Arkansas. ) The Little Sugar ride went off right as scheduled at 8am with a lead out of town, we were back far enough that we couldn’t see the lead, but I believe it was local police doing the work on that. Before too long we were on Gravel and off into the beautiful country known as North West Arkansas (and southwest Missouri).  There was a threat of rain, but that didn’t materialize. We did get a pretty scary looking storm at the rest stop, to the north of there it was dark and the wind started blowing pretty good for a bit, but for use on the Little Sugar course we remained dry with only a couple of seconds of spitting drops here or there.  The course itself was amazing, hilly but the hills were not TOO much. I did get off and walk on a couple of those hills however. I was able to hop back on and finish the climbs each time I did though. We made it to the the aid station at Whistling Springs Brewery without any noticeable trouble, though neither Wags nor I drank enough fluids in that first 2 hours on the ride. I chugged a bottle of Scratch that I had to try to force fluids in me and then grabbed some water at the brewery to fill both bottles back up. The aid station was stocked with Untapped Maple products, as well as other assorted items. I tried their “MapleAid” which I pictured as lemonade, had someone told me it was Tea I might have taken to it better, but expecting lemonade with maple flavor, I quickly poored out the sample that I had put in my bottle and just grabbed water instead. Wags went inside and grabbed himself a beer, as we all had “drink” tickets that we could use there. I grabbed some snacks and looked around a bit. With the storm appearing to be moving our way, I wasn’t too intersted in standing around, but I did get to see some of the beautiful property there, including a pig and dog wandering around saying hello to people. To get out of the brewery you climb up Whistling Springs road, I was chugging along the climb when I decided to stand up and put a little effort into it. This caused my rear tire to lose traction, my foot to immediately fall down to the bottom of my stroke, a quick unclip and I was hoofing it for a little while up the hill. It was shortly after leaving the brewery that we came across a maroon Toyota Tacoma, first coming at us, then after it turned around, it passed us going back the way from which it came. Not a minute or two later and we came across the same Tacoma stopped in the middle of the road. He stopped because a rider had fallen on the downhill, we could see a rider down in front of the truck. I immedatiately jumped off my bike, called 911 and began trying to figure out where we actually were so that we could get help to us. For now, for the families sake, I will leave out any additional details, if anyone from the family would like more info, please feel free to contact me. Wags and I stayed on the scene for about 45 minutes, before heading back out on the road. On the way out the ambulance was coming in, we were glad to see that.   The rest of the ride kind of blurs together, at one point Wags and I were talking about how we hadn’t had any of the 100 mile competitors pass us since the accident (maybe 15 came through while we were there, a BIG thank you to those who slowed down, to those of you who didn’t, a couple of the top 5 men’s riders, show some decency next time). We began to wonder if the organizers had closed the course at the Brewery for weather or something. It wasn’t until shortly after this conversation that we started to get riders coming by us from the 100, we found out later talking to a gentleman who finished in the 21st spot that they had actually shut the course down where the ambulance arrived on the scene.  Once the trickle started as 100 mile riders were passing us, the flood came. Mostly we were passed by the top men, but a number of women passed by as well, including Amity Rockwell. A big shout out to all the riders who passed us slower guys with words of encouragement, it was much appreciated each and every time someone said something. The finish required you to climb back up into the park area around the start of Slaughter Pen, you were on paved roads at this point, but was a slog for someone who wasn’t in shape and ready for a 50 mile ride. Wags waited for me and helped motivate me towards the finish as we crossed the line together, 5 hours and 21 minutes after we started, in 254th and 255th spot. I definitely had hoped to finish this ride in under 5 hours, hoping for closer to 4 hours, but with over 3k feet of elevation, and stopping for 45 minutes to assist, I am please that we still finished in 5:21. Post ride you were given a mug/mason jar of Untapped Maple syrup and a big lollipop (lots of SUGAR). Wags and I headed back to the car, loaded up the bikes and changed into some street clothing to be comfortable before heading back to the finish area to grab food from a food truck with our meal tickets. We sat down and talked to a few fellow competitors, and I chatted with Big Tall Wayne again (Wags and I spoke to him Friday at the 8th street market, as well as at Unbound earlier this year). Adelmann wandered up to us after he finished and he downed a bottle of my Scratch Labs drink that I had made while at the truck. He was struggling with nutritional issues and said he was fortunate to have finished having vision concerns the last ~30 miles of his ride. He averaged 14. 98mph on his ride, while Wagner and I averaged 9. 94mph. Strava Ride I got all sorts of comments on my jersey for the ride on Saturday. I wore my 2019 Cuban Gravel Crisis jersey. That WAS a real ride, and I gotta say, the best named gravel race in the history of gravel races. Unfortunately I hear rumors that the organizer of the ride no longer has rights to the name and is changing the name going forward, that’s unfortunate (looks like they let the domain expire even, that’s a shame)! If you’ve not made your way to North West Arkansas yet, definitely check it out. Bentonville, you are amazing. See you soon, next time my family is coming too. Be sure to check out BigSugarGravel. com for information on when registration will open for next year, you don’t want to miss this event! A big thanks goes out to the event organizers, and to the folks at LifeTime for reaching out on Sunday as well. My thoughts again go out to the family. "

View Photos   The Review: Two Years ago I was in Emporia Kansas for the Dirty Kanza, riding 100 miles on gravel for the first time. It wasn’t easy, I was slow, and spent most of the second half helping a buddy get through the ride while he was having some serious cramping. Overall we had a great weekend of riding and I made it a point to try to get back. I made that easier by attending the Lunar Kanza in July 2019 and obtaining a lotto bypass for 2020. As for everyone, 2020 didn’t go as planned, I did get a lot of riding in, but I wasn’t going to be ready for 200 miles if it had happened. Earlier this year I failed to start training/riding early, and ultimately spent about 2 months dealing with some heart issues where I wasn’t on the bike at all. Because of all that, I had to defer my 2021 entry to 2022 for the Unbound Gravel event. I already had a hotel room and wanted to be in Emporia to experience the fun that comes with the event so myself and Wagner (Wags) headed on down anyways. We signed up to volunteer to work 10 hours so that we could ensure that Wags got in for 2022, and hopefully bring my brother or another friend along with us too based on my hours worked. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Tahoe-800-99042f59f. jpg” alt=”“The Tweeting Tahoe Loaded Up”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Tahoe-200-99042f59f. jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Tahoe-400-99042f59f. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Tahoe-800-99042f59f. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Tahoe-1600-99042f59f. jpg 1600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Tahoe-2000-99042f59f. jpg 2000w”&gt; We headed down on Thursday afternoon so that we could make a quick pass through the expo before it closed down that evening. The drive down from St. Louis was uneventful, unlike our drive down in 2019, we did see a couple of gravel bikes on racks on the way west. We arrived in Emporia shortly before 6pm. Once there we walked around the All Things Gravel Expo, checked out Gravel City and their shop and headed over to our hotel to get checked in to the Econo Lodge. While the Econo Lodge was cheap, and overall it was comfortable, we were severely disappointed the first night when we walked up to the second floor and it reeked of cigarette smoke and beer. Ultimately the hotel worked out okay, I think the guys who were smoking/drinking were workers and Friday they headed back to their homes for the weekend. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/GravelEnds-800-b1551f2c2. jpg” alt=”“Friday Morning Ride”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/GravelEnds-200-b1551f2c2. jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/GravelEnds-400-b1551f2c2. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/GravelEnds-800-b1551f2c2. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/GravelEnds-1600-b1551f2c2. jpg 1600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/GravelEnds-2000-b1551f2c2. jpg 2000w”&gt; Friday morning we got up and headed back into town, parking in the same lot from the night before. We took off on our bikes and rode the 25-mile route before we needed to be at our first volunteer assignment. The riding was great, it was definitely starting to warm up and we were thankful that we got the ride in early and that we would be “working” inside at the packet pickup area. We made another pass through the expo before work where Wags ran into a childhood friend he raced BMX with in St. Louis. In the Expo I saw Frankie Andreu and got introduced to Tinker Jaurez, BMX legend. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/FrankieAndTinker-800-2eab7ee9e. jpg” alt=”“Frankie Andreu and Tinker Juarez”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/FrankieAndTinker-200-2eab7ee9e. jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/FrankieAndTinker-400-2eab7ee9e. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/FrankieAndTinker-800-2eab7ee9e. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/FrankieAndTinker-1496-2eab7ee9e. jpg 1496w”&gt; We checked in with the volunteer coordinator and I spent the next 3. 5 hours handing out T-Shirts to mostly 200-mile riders, but a few 100 riders as well. I got to hand a shirt to Ashton Lamby and Amity Rockwell among many others. Wags was passing out bags during that time and got to give a bag to both of those riders as well. He also talked to Jeremiah about the Impossible Route. After working we made another pass through the Expo to grab any additional swag we had missed. As a Vegan (almost 1. 5 years now) I was worried about what I might find to eat. At Gravel City I saw a gentleman behind the counter with a tofu bowl, so I asked where he got it and he pointed me to Chi Em Eats, a Vietnamese place just down the street. I ordered a bowl from them and picked it up, Wags grabbed another burrito from the food truck at the expo and we sat and talked to a few locals over dinner. We had a great experience with every local we ran into in Emporia, they all appear to love the event and all the people it brings into town. We even ran into a guy an hour out of town when filling up with gas that was happy we were heading down. Saturday morning we got up early and headed north to Alma where we would be spending the morning working the first checkpoint on the 200-mile route. Most of my time there was spent directing/holding traffic at the one flashing light in town, stopping traffic when any riders were coming through, and letting the traffic through at appropriate times. Almost every one of those we had to stop was pleasant and supportive, though I do recall one truck that wasn’t too happy about having to take 30 seconds out of his day to sit there. While in Alma I got to spend some time walking around with my camera, getting some photos of the leaders of the 200 coming through, and then various other riders coming through, getting service, and heading out of town, you can see those linked here. After our volunteer time in Alma, Wags and I were starving, so we grabbed lunch at the local Mexican joint before heading back towards Emporia. We were exhausted, and initially planned to head back to the hotel and rest before heading back into the fun of the finish area. On the way down we checked the results and noticed that the leaders from the 200 race were just getting through Council Grove, this caused us to divert west over to Americus so that we could sit on the side of the road and get some photos and cheer people along. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/BoswellandTenDam-800-ade894799. jpg” alt=”“Ian Boswell and Laurens ten Dam at Unbound Gravel 200”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/BoswellandTenDam-200-ade894799. jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/BoswellandTenDam-400-ade894799. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/BoswellandTenDam-800-ade894799. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/BoswellandTenDam-1600-ade894799. jpg 1600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/BoswellandTenDam-2000-ade894799. jpg 2000w”&gt; &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/TedKing-800-7273ae54c. jpg” alt=”“Ted King Unbound Gravel 200”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/TedKing-200-7273ae54c. jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/TedKing-400-7273ae54c. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/TedKing-800-7273ae54c. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/TedKing-1600-7273ae54c. jpg 1600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/TedKing-2000-7273ae54c. jpg 2000w”&gt; We got to see the top 5 200-mile riders pass by, and a number of 100-mile riders before we headed back into town. Later that evening we went back out to the finish area, I really wanted to try to get a selfie with Alison Tetrick to go with the one I got with her in 2019.      View this post on Instagram      A post shared by Christopher Hammond (@thechristoc) From the finish line I wanted to see if we could get somewhere on course to try to get a good sunset shot with riders out on the course, and then some night sky photos out there as well, ideally with a rider or two. We headed west towards Lake Kahola, I remembered that area from my prior rides there in Emporia, and I knew that some of the gravel roads out there might provide me a good place to shoot from. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Stars-800-6cc7e8eb9. jpg” alt=”“The Night Sky over Unbound Gravel”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Stars-200-6cc7e8eb9. jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Stars-400-6cc7e8eb9. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Stars-800-6cc7e8eb9. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Stars-1600-6cc7e8eb9. jpg 1600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Stars-2000-6cc7e8eb9. jpg 2000w”&gt; I ended up not getting the great Night Sky shots that I wanted, but we did sit out on the course on a climb just before the 20 miles left point, where we cheered on riders until just after midnight. I took photos until I just couldn’t get any decent ones in the dark, with a couple of night sky shots turning out. It was a somewhat cloudy night and more clouds definitely moved in the longer we sat there. The riders that came by mostly appeared to be appreciative of our cheering at them. We found that they either were thankful or zombie-like (understandable after 180 miles). I never thought I would have so much fun at an event not riding, but Wags and I had a blast all weekend. Being there, cheering people on, encouraging them to keep going, taking photos, helping out, it was great. If you don’t get into the Unbound Gravel event next year through the lottery, you absolutely should look at volunteering. This year the deal was that you had to work at least 10 hours to get a bypass for 2022, I would assume they will do something similar for 2023, you should consider this! It’s a great intro to the Emporia atmosphere and gives you time to get out there on the course and get some rides in for you as well. Thanks to everyone within the LifeTime and Unbound organizations for a great weekend! See you next year, I’m planning on 200 miles, training started last month. "

    "body": "2021/03/15 - So what’d you do this past weekend? Did you ride The Mid South? They shifted things up this year, went to a virtual “incredibly socially distant” version of the event.  Everyone is getting 50% of their reg fee refunded starting today. It might take a few days to deposit so be patient!We are physically mailing out your Mid South swag bag with t-shirt, water bottle, and more to your front door! It will be there before event weekend. If you’re signed up for the race YOU’RE IN. All you will need to do moving forward is join the Ride With GPS challenge page and upload your ride/run. You must ride/run and record your activity on one of the dates between March 12-14. Our partner bike shops are creating 50k, 50mi, 100mi routes in their areas for many of you to be able to ride/run. Sponsors will be sending swag to each of these shops for you to win on a first come, first serve basis after you’ve completed their specific Mid South partner route. If you don’t live in one of the partner shop areas you can upload your own course/activity from your backyard to the Ride With GPS challenge page. You will not be able to win swag from the bike shops BUT you will be entered to win from a list of GRAND prizes. We will be drawing names from the complete list of all participants that uploaded their ride/run from the event weekend on Monday March 15th. Prizes include a Salsa Stormchaser, 5 free entries to Mid South 2022, free bike shipping to and from Mid South 2022 AND a free entry to thtruee race courtesy of Bike Flights, and our biggest prize of all the “Eternal Entry. ” It lasts forever. More details soon. I had intentions of training and riding locally here in St. Louis for this, but 2021 got in the way. First, I had motivation issues starting out the year. I think I’ve been on the trainer once in 2021. Then in February I apparently started experiencing Atrial Fibrillation. My heart rate has been f’d up since the morning of 2/19. I went to bed late, around 1am, and according to my Garmin Fenix my heart rate has been f’d up ever since. I’ve got an appointment for a procedure tomorrow that will hopefully reset my heart rhythm that will hopefully get me back to normal and get me out on the bike again. The Mid South 2022 will be March 11th and 12th, 2022. Registration for that will open in October. They had a Facebook Live stream today after the weekend and awarded some prizes. The coolest being the Eternal Entry. Basically a free liftime entry to The Mid South. There’s a catch though. It has to be used every year or it goes away. It CAN be passed on though. It’ll be cool to see that get tracked, will the same person use it every year? Will someone different get to use it every year? "

    "body": "2020/10/29 - Hot off the presses, Dirty Kanza is no more, long may those who are unchained live Unbound!&nbsp; &nbsp; FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Contact: Jordan Titus | jtitus@lt. life | 218. 780. 6161 &nbsp; Life Time Reveals New Brand for Emporia Gravel&nbsp; Event: UNBOUND Gravel Internationally renowned for the remote, rugged and unforgiving journey it provides riders, the former DK gravel event begins a new chapter in 2021 &nbsp; EMPORIA, Kans. , October 30, 2020&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Life Time&nbsp;is&nbsp;pleased to announce the new name for its wildly popular Emporia, Kans. -based gravel event. &nbsp;UNBOUND Gravel&nbsp;will carry on the 15-year history, legacy and energy of the original event with a new identity. Garmin will remain on as title sponsor of the event. &nbsp;  Our team agreed that we wanted a name, logo and colors that embody the Flint Hills of Kansas. This region, and the hilly, sharp gravel roads that accompany it, are what help make this event what it has become: known widely today as the World's Premier Gravel Event. We know the life impact this event has on people and we wanted a strong brand that participants felt proud of, that we could tell stories around, and that tied literally and figuratively to the area,  said Michelle Duffy, Director of Off-Road Events Marketing at Life Time.  The word UNBOUND most literally means to be free. It represents the free-range cattle, wild mustangs and native bison in the prairie of the Flint Hills, who move freely and live wildly. It's synonymous with our participants who experience a sense of freedom on the gravel roads outside of Emporia, and in those moments feel  unbound  from anything else. Just the rider and the tire-shredding, sun-baking, breathtaking Flint Hills gravel.   &nbsp; In support of the new name and branding process, Life Time established a task force composed of Emporia business and tourism leaders, representatives of the cycling media, members of the cycling community&mdash;including a past champion and a two-time podium finisher&mdash;alongside its internal brand and marketing leaders. Additionally, other members of the gravel cycling community, along with partners and athletes, and a survey of many members of the DK community were instrumental in validating that &lsquo;UNBOUND Gravel' meets the event's future vision. Finally, members of the Emporia-based events team visited Kaw Nation, Okla. to visit with members of the Tribal Council to openly discuss the renaming of the event and share the planned path forward. &nbsp;  This rebrand is the end of a chapter for us as the DK, but we'll continue to embrace the history of the land on which we ride. We hope that each time riders touch the gravel roads in the Flint Hills, they take a moment to remember what has been,  said Kristi Mohn, UNBOUND Gravel Marketing Manager.  UNBOUND Gravel provides an opportunity to reimagine what an event&nbsp;can look like, and this rebrand is only step one in the process. So much is yet to come for the gravel community.   &nbsp; In keeping with the establishment of its DEI Coalition, Life Time is committed to providing access and education to all individuals, while initiating industry shifts around inclusiveness at events. The organization has&nbsp;pledged to impact change across the industry&nbsp;as a whole, using its 30+ events as a platform. The team is taking deliberate steps to enact change for riders and runners across BIPOC, LGBTQ+, gender-focused, economically disenfranchised and para groups, including lowering the barrier of entry to the sport, providing access to start lines, gaining a clear understanding of who we are, so that we can identify and implement the work that must be done and evoking change to benefit the entire Life Time family of athletes, volunteers, partners, team members and the broader endurance sport community. &nbsp; Furthering the Company's commitment to the community, the event rebrand comes on the heels of the&nbsp;Life Time Foundation&nbsp;announcing a multi-year partnership with Emporia Public Schools, through which it has committed $95,000 in funding for a School Food Program that will impact more than 4,300 students across nine schools. &nbsp; The 2021 All Things Gravel Expo will kick off on June 3, with race day being Saturday, June 5. 2021 deferral registration will launch for participants with entry from the cancelled 2020 event on Monday, November 16.

    "body": "2020/04/06 - So Dirty Kanza had their  virtual gravel camp  this weekend. Going into this, I figured it would be leading up to something. Some change, I assumed a cancellation for 2020 and reschedule for 2021, due to coronavirus. I was wrong (I am glad I was), this evening they announced that they were moving the ride to September 12th, 2020. There's a lot of information on the FAQ, my completely unofficial summary for those who are already registered for 2020: You can ride on 9/12, without changing anything about your reservation You can defer to 2021 (6/5/2021) without any fee, and not having to pay again next year) if you do so by 5/15/2020. You can get a refund for your 2020 entry fee, if you choose to do so by 5/15/2020, but you will need to enter the lotto again for 2021. If you aren't registered for 2020, but want to, at this point, I don't believe that's an option. Will it stay that way, who knows. I quickly looked through the FAQ (linked above) earlier and realized, crap, my hotel reservation is for the original weekend. I booked that hotel in the middle of June 2019, just weeks after DK 2019. I immediately logged into my hotel honors account and looked to try to change my reservation. No dice, the hotel is completely blocked from 9/9/2020 through 9/13/2020. I checked every hotel I could in Emporia, they are ALL Blocked that week. I was despondent. I decided to try to call the hotel, at 9:20pm on a Sunday night, in the middle of Coronavirus lockdowns. I got a remote reservation agent, she checked, she couldn't find me a spot either, the hotel is blocked off. She offered to call the front desk and see, so I took her up on that offer. After quite a hold, she came back and told me that the hotel is currently blocked off, BUT, they were taking names and going to be calling people back. It sounds like, and remember this is completely unofficial, and possibly wrong, they might actually be blocking that week for existing reservations from the original dates, to move them. I was told that they would call me back this week, and see about moving the reservations for me. I'm extremely hopeful that this works out! My advice: Call your hotel, see if they are doing something similar, hopefully for you they are! I have a feeling that hotel space, as always, will be a premium, especially with the new date and school being in session at the college, where they normally open up dorm rooms for DK participants to use in late May/early June. Update 4/6/2020: I was able to get in touch with my hotel this morning and they moved my reservation. The rate is quite a bit higher, but at this point I wasn't going to argue. &nbsp; Update 4/8/2020: I reached out to the hotel again via their online chat, they talked to the manager, who then emailed me. I was inquiring about the rate that has doubled my overall cost for loding for DK 2020. &nbsp; Basically they said: They were already charging this rate before DK moved, there is another event in town that same weekend, and with the dorms unavailable, and a hotel having recently closed down completely, rooms are at a premium. . . So at this point I don't have any belief that I'll get my rate lowered down to less than $299 a night that we are currently being charged. That being said, I do have two rooms right now, long term I might not hold on to that second room, but I am keeping both depending on who all comes and rides, if more friends get in, or my wife decides to help crew, I need the extra space.

Personally, we started out January strong, got a few outdoor rides in, and quite a few training rides, but here we are the 9th of February and we haven’t been on either bike in 9 days, and it will be tomorrow before we are back on the trainer. We are going to quickly try to change that and get things moving again, we have 5 weeks until Stillwater (The Mid South, formerly known as the LandRun100). So training needs to kick into high gear. To do that, we’re going to venture down to St. James, Missouri next weekend for the Prairie Roubaix 100k. The ride starts/finishes at the Public House there in St. James, and has a 50k or 100k option. While you are at The Public House, see if you can’t find any of their Best Ever beer, part of their St. Patrick’s specials for MST down the road in Rolla. "

I realized once we got there that I had been there, almost 20 years ago, shooting photos at a concert for a local band from Cuba called N2Versatle. The CGC offered 3 ride lengths, 100/50/25, with the 100 starting at 7am and the 50/25 starting at 9am. I met the posse at CrossFit Wildwood and we headed down together in the Tahoe. This ride brought together the DK100 (Steve and Lybarger) crew and added in the mustached wonder of Wagner, we were team 3 Chrises and a Steve. Cuba was just over an hour away from the gym, so it was an easy drive down 44, a road so familiar from my many trips to/from Rolla for school years ago (I met n2Versatle as a DJ at the college radio station back in the day). We knew going into the ride that it was going to be a cold one, with start time forecasts showing 32-34 degrees. What we were not prepared for was how cold that would be! While waiting in line for the check in we quickly were brought up to speed on what Winter is like, because we had forgotten&hellip;. Missouri skipped Fall for a weekend, though&nbsp; now, two weeks later the weather was finally back into fall mode, today however it is going to get up towards 70. At check in we received our packages, which contained a bib number and timing chip. I mistakenly removed my timing chip, assuming that I needed to put it on my helmet, before realizing they had stabled the chip to the number so that we didn't need to mount it externally. We headed to the only warm place on site, the restroom, and prepped before getting the bikes ready. I've really taken to utilizing the Chamois Butter this year. With that, in combination with my new Specialized Power Expert saddle from Trailhead earlier this year, my riding has never been more comfortable! Bike prep was pretty straight forward, get your bottles together, computer turned on, air in the tires. The real prep was clothing! I was wearing my Pearl Izumi thermal full length bib, wool socks, and a long sleeve Hincapie jersey. On my head I wore a PI head band to cover my ears, and threw on a Maxxis neck gaiter I got at Dirty Kanza this year. On my hands I wore a pair of warmer Craft gloves, and had those inserted into my bar mitts I had installed the night before on the Niner RLT. The Bar Mitts, holy cow, I can't recommend them enough. After about 15 miles I had to take my gloves off and go with a much thinner pair, because the combo of the Craft gloves and bar mitts were causing my hands to be downright hot. Caution on the bar mitts though. They can be cumbersome, and get in the way. They limit your grip options on a drop bar bike, leaving you unable to access the drops, but in cold weather, they are totally worth it. The ride started by heading out of hood park on an old gravel road following the train tracks that runs along side of Historic Route 66. The start felt a little unorganized, it was hard to hear the announcers due to the size of the crowd and distance from the PA, but once on the road things started to spread out. The road was marked with painted arrows, which worked out well for the most part, with only a couple of minor problems for people who either couldn't get their route isnto their bike computer (looking at you Wagner) or people who missed the arrows when marked poorly (also looking at you Wagner).  For the most part, the three Chrises rode in the near vicinity of each other all day, while Steve was a little further back riding his mountain bike with MTB tires mounted, instead of his gravel tires. We all stopped at the rest stop around mile 15 in Steeleville, and then again around mile 25 when Wagner hit a gravel pothole that helped to alleviate the air from the tire on his ride. He quickly popped the tube off of the rim of the bike, to discover that the sealant used on his tubeless setup had turned into Loctite for the nut holding his valve stem in. He was going to pop a tube in and keep riding. We should have simply tried filling it up with air, before popping the bead on the tire. We spent the next 28 minutes trying to figure out how to get the nut off the valve stem. We asked every rider who went by if they had a pair of pliers, no one did. No one had a Leatherman, we were stuck. Mike Weiss from Bike Shark Bicycle Company stopped with an old car racing friend of mine, Bryan. Mike and Bryan both attempted to get the nut off, to no avail as well. Until finally a rider stopped, he had acquired a new tool the prior week, and while it wasn't exactly pliers, it was close enough to pliers that Mike was able to get the nut free. Wagner threw a tube in the tire, pumped it back up and we were on our way again. Not long after the tire change, we county road E, which lead us down towards Cave Rd, which was going to be a quite the climb, followed by a jaunt through Onandaga Cave State Park, another location I visited 20 years ago (to the month) for the wedding of a pair of friends. These two climbs were tough, but they had to be done if we wanted to finish the ride, so we pushed through and rode on. Shortly after Onandaga, Wagner pulled away from myself and Lybarger as he is always much stronger on the hills than I am. Lybarger and I knew there was a rest stop coming up near Leasburg, but we weren't quite sure how far away it was. We ended up stopping about 1/4 mile beforehand to take a break and refuel, only to find the stop shortly there after and take another break. We almost missed the turn for the stop as the only marking I saw was on the left, on the inside of the left hand turn, thankfully my navigation was working. Unfortunately for Wagner, he missed this turn and end up with an extra 4 miles before the rest stop outside of Leasburg. After the rest stop, I was feeling extra lethargic and Lybarger headed off ahead of me. We both knew we were close, within the last 12 or 13 miles. Those are always the worst, the final slog, when the body wants you to stop, but you keep telling it that you are almost done and can rest later. Coming into the finish, much later than initially planned, both due to the 30 minute mechanical, and more so due to the 5k feet of climbing that the route had, was a welcome experience. The crowds of my last couple of bigger rides (DK and Pedal The Cause) were non-existent, but the finish was just as nice. &nbsp; I came through and immediately rode back to the Tahoe to get off the bike. Lybarger came over, with food in hand and pointed me towards a tent and food truck parked not too far away. I walked over to those to see what sustenance I could find. I found some pork sliders for $2 a pop, I got 2, and a soda from the food truck next door. Not the biggest meal, but enough to hold me over as I waited for Wagner and Steve to finish their rides. When they were finished we quickly loaded up and hit the road back to St. Louis. I had to get home to some family things, so we couldn't stick around, and didn't even have time to stop anywhere on the way home to grab some food. Overall this event was great. Beautiful route, HOLY HILLS there was a lot of elevation. Definitely a ride to look forward to again in 2020!  "

    "body": "2019/10/01 - It is (past) that time of year, Pedal The Cause 2019. Here in St. Louis Pedal The Cause is one of, if not the, biggest charity bike rides you can find. It takes place on the beautiful cycling roads of west county, starting in Chesterfield, spending most of its time in Wildwood, with a little loop down to Eureka as well depending on the length of the ride you do. You can even cross the Missouri River and ride in St. Charles County and Maryland Heights if you choose the Two Bridges route. The event offers a variety of distances, from spinning on site at the Chesterfield Amphitheater, a 10 Mile (PTC Circuit), 20 Mile (PTC Classic), 37 Mile (Two Bridges), 50 Mile (Big Hitter), 62 Mile (Metric Century) to the&nbsp; 98 Mile (Century). Ranging in Elevation from 321 feet to 4,809 feet for the century. Depending on the distance you sign up for, and when you sign up, you commit to raising a certain level of funds. Riding the Century route, and registering before July 1st, I committed to raising at least $600, had I signed up after July 1st, I would have needed to commit to $1,000. In previous years I had ran on the Team ASG-SPS team, but this year I changed things up. I wanted to try to put together a team for the gym we go to, so I started the CrossFit Wildwood team. We had 7 members total on the team, 2 other members from CrossFit Wildwood, 2 members from the ASG-SPS team, and my kids signed up for the team challenge. We set a team goal of raising $5,000, which I'll be honest, a few weeks ago, it seemed like we wouldn't get anywhere close to that goal. But as of right now, we have $4,695, and I believe we have another $2,000 coming in from a fund raising event we held with the St. Louis Region SCCA Solo program back on the 22nd of September. I haven't figured out what will happen with the team next year, if I can get a few more CrossFit Wildwood members to join the team and ride, we will&nbsp; keep it going, otherwise might just switch back to the ASG-SPS team with Dave and Beth. So how did Sunday go? Well, it was both WET and HOT. The morning started out with wet roads from a morning shower that came through before the start of the ride. It didn't rain too much, if at all, during the ride, but much of the roads were wet throughout the day. You had to breath through your nose while you were riding as to not collect/drink spray from the rider in front of you, and at each rest stop you needed to clean your glasses. The morning started out very humid in the mid 70s, and only went UP from there. It ultimately got HOT. So hot that they actually closed down a section of the course, the Babler Beast, the inner loop around Babler State Park. I started the ride with Aaron, riding with the Stifel team, but also a member at CrossFit Wildwood. We took off at a decent clip, but started towards the back of the group, so we couldn't totally gun it to try to stay with the fastest riders. Through Chesterfield Valley I feel like we could of used a larger pack for more speed, but we kept up a good clip and had a great conversation along the way. We skipped the first aid station at the Taubman outlets, and kept pedaling to get to the other side of the valley to stop at the aid station at the John L. LeCave Memorial Trailhead at the end of the Monarch Levy Trail. If I recall correctly, this was about mile 24 into the ride. Here I refilled a bottle with Gatorade, took a shot of pickle juice and had a half a PB&amp;J sandwich. From there we headed out towards Wildhorse Creek and then up Ossenfort. I told Aaron not to worry about waiting for me, as much riding as I've done this year, I feel like my hill climbing hasn't been very good, so I figured he would be much faster up the hills and I wouldn't see him again. I am pleased to say I kept up with him for the first two hills, Ossenfort and Little Tavern. Once we got up to Hencken though, I was cooked and he was much faster. We met back up at the aid station in Greensfelder, and headed south on Allenton together. The loop south of 44 in Eureka is a pretty rough road, and steep climb to start, at this point I lost sight of Aaron and would only see him at two more rest stops going forward. Going up this first hill south of 44 I got really upset. I was climbing along, struggling, and I hear what I thought was a car behind me, I even started to yell  car back  to the riders ahead of me when I turned and saw an older gentleman cruising up and past me on his e-bike. This triggered me, here I was struggling, and here goes this guy just casually pedaling along, assisted, with ease. I really wasn't mad at him, but I was upset with jealousy. Later in the day, when he passed me 3 or 4 more times going up different hills, that's when I started to get upset. Good for him, he's out riding. But man, if you're going to pass a slow guy on climbs with your e-bike, stay in front of him so you don't have to insult him EVERY DAMN HILL there is. At the top of Allenton I stopped at the Greensfelder aid station again and went to the bike mechanic for some lube. My chain was loud as could be, and I hoped they could help me. I don't know why I put dry lube on the bike two nights before, at the Hermann Gravel challenge I learned that the dry lube comes right off in the wet conditions and makes a hell of a racket when it does. I was able to get some lube and the bad sounds went away for the rest of the day. From Greensfelder (the second time) you head back to Melrose, down and then up through Rockwoods Reservation back up to Old Manchester. Old Manchester goes west back out to Melrose and up to where Ossenfort and Melrose meet. At this point I stopped to rest in the shade a bit and chat with another gym Member, Beahm, who was volunteering at the aid station. I questioned his choice in Music, the guy must be late 20s, MAYBE early 30s, but he's rocking classic rock like it is going out of style. He must of been raised here in St. Louis listening to KSHE through his youth instead of 105. 7 The Point. From there you head down Ossenfort, which is always questionable when wet, by this point in the afternoon many of the shaded roads were still wet, even though the heat was climbing. My Garmin recorded a 99 degree temperature reading around there. From the base of Ossenfort it was down towards Highway T. This section of the ride, in the past, always sucks. You are completely exposed, no shade, going up an incline back towards Highway 100. For some reason, 2019 was different. I felt revived on this stretch of road and managed to pass two riders ahead of me and get across 100 and back on to Old Manchester in record time (for me). It was still sunny, and hot, but it didn't drain me along Highway T like I expected. Then it was a run east on Old Manchester to Pond, out to Babler State Park. I was definitely getting hot, and not pushing for any PRs along this section of the route. I was looking forward to Babler, because the aid station there typically has orange bandanas sitting in a cooler full of ice water, and on a hot day, these bandanas go a long way to making you feel cooler/better. I arrived at Babler, with the intention of grabbing an ice cold bandana, and then heading into the park for the  Babler Beast , a counter clockwise loop of the park with a hell of a climb towards the end. Unfortunately when I asked for a bandana, I was told they didn't have any, and offered a cold paper towel. I said I would just grab one on the way back through, after doing the loop, but was quickly told that they had closed the part of the course in the park. Due to heat and injuries, they shut it down. I honestly was not too thrilled with this news. I have been training for Pedal The Cause all year, with the intention of finishing the full ride this year, something I've only done once previously. I wasn't about to let this stop me, so I headed up the chute to where the close was closed, and I just went. They chased me, they yelled, they event sent a police helicopter, but I went anyways. I ended up completing the loop, in probably one of my slowest times ever, but I completed it. I was definitely hot at this point, so I made sure to take my time, and rested before going up the big climb. As I was going up the climb, I decided to stop and take two breaks, instead of stopping and walking, I let my heart rate come back down and relaxed. I also didn't want to overheat and need medical assistance, especially after I went against the ride's wishes, so I took my time, and I made my way around Babler State Park. When I stopped to rest at the Babler aid station again I noticed that two other riders came in behind me, also deciding to take to the closed section of the course. I ran into Steve at this point, who unfortunately told me he was experiencing cramping issues again. Wasn't much I could offer him, so I went ahead and&nbsp; left Babler and headed out for what I knew would be the worst part of the course. For me the last 20 miles of Pedal the cause every year is the worst. You have one hill, Reiger, which isn't too bad, then you head down Wildhorse, a steep descent and then follow along the creek for 3-4 miles. After that you head down to Centaur and back to the LeCave trailhead. This section of the road isn't too bad, but when you're doing it solo you just want to be done. I'm typically riding this section of road with other riders, but for Pedal I always seem to be by myself, so it gets lonely to run by yourself. After the aid station at Centaur, you head down the Levy trail and then through Chesterfield Valley back up a climb on Baxter to the amphitheater. The first 3 miles on the Levy trail were great, the wind was at my back, and my riding was quick, After passing under the Boone bridge you go east, RIGHT INTO A DAMN HEADWIND (it was actually from the southeast, so&hellip; it go worse). I lost 6mph on my speed into this wind, and I was going to be heading east/southeast the rest of the ride. This is where I broke. I simply couldn't keep any speed up, my motivation was sapped. I wasn't about to give up on the ride, but my pedaling slowed, and I was passed by 3 individuals within the last 1/2 mile of the finish. 98. 24 miles according to my Garmin After the ride I had intentions of grabbing Sugarfire BBQ, but I was completely spent. I grabbed two bottles of Propel from the cheer/dance team handing out medals and water at the finish, found some shade and laid down for 20 minutes to recover. A big thank you to everyone who rode this year, volunteered this year, and anyone who donated to any pedal the cause rider or team. Aaron finished his first century, by riding some extra distance afterwards to get to the full 100 miles. Dave finished 73 miles, cutting out some of the course due to the conditions. Steve unfortunately had to get the SAG wagon back to the event start, seccumbing to the cramps. Now it is back to Gravel season. I'll be getting my Niner RLT setup this week and will be back on gravel roads to get ready for the Cuban Gravel Crisis coming up in less than two weeks. "

Isn't Toddler366 enough for you Chris? No, it isn't. So what is 30 Days of Biking? Well, plain and simple, bicycling at least once, every day, in April 2012. Why? Why not. Biking is good for you, the more you do it, the better you feel, the better shape you are in. How much will you be riding? That depends on my schedule. Some days it will just be a quick ride around the neighborhood, some days I'll get in multiple rides. Hopefully every day I will get at least one ride in though, even if it is short. The difficult part for me is that I am likely going to be travelling to the east coast at the end of the month, and getting a ride in with that may prove hard, though I may try to ride a couple of times, even if short, with my good buddy Stephen Jones from www. velonation. com, but we'll see how that comes along. With each ride, assuming I ride with my Garmin, I will post up my Strava report from the ride. So here is Day 1's ride.  Yesterday morning we headed off to REI to see what we might find at the Garage Sale. We didn't plan on buying anything, but we had never been, so we went with open minds. Well, we scored. We ended up getting the iBert Safe-T-Seat Front Child Seat (Green,38-Pounds limit) for a steal, really, too low to even post about here! We immediately went home and tried putting it on my Cannondale Quick CX 1, unfortunately it wouldn't work on that bike, so we tried it on Natalie's Quick CX 3 and it did work. Jacqueline loves it! As you can see in the photo at the top of the post. "

    "body": "2012/01/19 - One of the things that I’ve been trying to do while riding is figure out how to record my rides, for a couple of reasons. 1) To create cool creative videos. 2) To document events, who knows what can happen on the road, having video proof could help out some day. I think I can safely say that #2 is a far better, easier to attain, idea, than #1. And when you come up with a reason that justifies #2, you likely have something worth using for #1. Why might I say that? Well it is pretty simple, bike riding video is rather boring. At least the video that my 34 year old ass is able to shoot while riding. Why? A number of reasons. I’m just getting started with riding, having put on about 144 miles on a bike in the first 3 weeks of the year, last year I put just under 600 miles in total, and what I ride would be considered rather tame, at least, it is rather tame in my eyes. I don’t do downhill mountain biking, I haven’t done any group rides, it is just me, sometimes me and my wife, or me and a friend, riding. Mostly road, but occasional dirt paths and trails. Nothing exciting by any means. So the videos that come from that riding are to put it bluntly BORING. See the following video for example. This video is from last weekend, I went out to Orinda with a buddy of mine to ride, we rode 14. 5 miles, climbing 1. 6k feet, the most climbing I have ever done on a bike. Our average speed was 8mph… You can see where I am going with this, boring video! Though it does look a little more interesting when you compress that 1. 75 hours into 2 minutes. and don’t forget the video from a couple of months ago riding around Half Moon Bay, CA These videos were all taken with one of my GoPro Camera HD HERO2 Motorsports Edition CHDMH-002. What do you think? Is bicycle riding video boring in general, or just mine? "

    "body": "2012/01/10 - As I get more and more into cycling I am looking for more and more things to get my cycling. I live in Half Moon Bay, and while my wife has started to ride as well, it is hard for us to get out for long rides because we have a 15 month old baby (15 months today!, happy 15 months Jacqueline). While we get out occasionally with the baby in tow, we typically each ride solo. In that quest to find riding events and people to ride with, etc I stumbled on SF2G, a club (website) for people in the bay area looking for others to ride with. I believe it started out as a way to get people to ride their bikes from San Francisco City to Google, by some Google employees. It has grown into 1800+ members and a variety of different rides, along with members from a wide range of companies and locations. Every first Friday of the month they do a First Friday Friendly Frolic (FFFF) in which they go with a No Rider Left Behind policy. They leave from a designated location and head south on the  BayWay  which primarily covers the bayside trail, and the necessary side streets in order to make it all the way down to the Google offices and various others. I am going to try to ride with them starting this February, though in order for me to do this I am going to have to do things a little out of the ordinary. I don't have the legs (yet) to ride from Half Moon Bay to my office in San Mateo, much less up to the starting point for FFFF, so I am going to drive up to the Daly City Bart station, then ride Bart up to wherever I need to go to meet up with FFFF. Then ride along until Foster City, at which point I will jump off and head west to the DotNetNuke offices. This is a little backwards, out of the way, but it is something I feel like I should try to do. Then hopefully, after work, I can ride my back to the Milbrae Bart station, and then catch that back to Daly City to get my car. "

    "body": "2011/07/17 -  So this isn’t going to be a long tip, as this topic will likely fill out future tips as well, but for now I will raise a question. How do you track your rides? Or, do you track your rides? At this point in time I use Garmin Connect and SportstrackLive. com. Why do I use both? Well I have a Garmin Forerunner 305 that I use, mounted to the handlebars on the bike, with a heart rate monitor and cadence monitor. It tracks things rather well, bit I figure having two sources of data can’t hurt. For SportstrackLive I use my Motorola Droid, running Android 2. 2. 2. SportstrackLive works alright, though I haven’t bothered to get any attachments for it (heart rate, or cadence). I find that I like the Garmin website interface better than STL, but to be honest, both of them leave me wanting more. I feel like I should get more out of the websites. Neither of them seem to provide me anything along the lines of “hey someone else rides the same place you do”. Being that my wife and I are just getting into the bicycling thing, I wonder if riding would be more interesting (not that it isn’t right now) if we rode with other people? Someone to push/pull us along? Watching the Tour this year, I’ve seen plenty of advertisements for MapMyRide, but I’ve yet to try the software out yet. Anyone have any experience/opinion on it? I do find that having the data drives me to ride more. I like being able to run reports on my riding to see that I’ve put in 161 miles since May 1st. "
