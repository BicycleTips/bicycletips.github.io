    "title": "",
    "body": "2025/01/15 -  For 2011 I personally set 3 goals, you can read about them fully on my post from 1/1/2011. Basically they were to lose 30 lbs (goal weight of 255, I'm a big guy), inline skate 100 miles (I do like me some skating, I'm a freak I know this) and ride a bike 500 miles. At the beginning of 2011 the bike I had was a 2004 Diamondback XTS Moto, not exactly something you could see yourself riding 500 miles on (at least not me). So in June I picked up a Cannondale Quick CX 1 and began my journey. As I posted back in November, I met the goal of riding 500 miles on the bike, and I fully intended to hit the skating goal of 100 miles. I am sad to say however, that I didn't skate 100 miles, and I didn't lose 30lbs last year, more like 7lbs. The weight was a rather lofty goal, but skating was definitely doable. I did manage to skate ~55 miles, but I really fell in love with cycling last year, so the skating definitely fell by the way side. My final bicycling total for 2011 was 572. 36 miles, and while looking at other people's riding numbers, it isn't much, it was a great achievement for me, and hopefully a great start to many years of riding. For 2012 I am setting some new goals, but this time I am not going to say  I want to lost the remaining 23lbs (I did lose/keep off 7lbs in 2011). I am not going to set any inline skating goals, while I hope to still skate some in 2012. I am also not going to set an official mileage goal, though I would think that 12-1500 should be doable with the other goals listed below. I am going to set the following goals, and hopefully they will help me towards getting in shape and losing weight, the weight is not the focus. With all of the following goals, I would hope that I can find some friends, or make some new ones, that want to participate with me. If so, please use the Contact form on the About page.  LiveSTRONG Challenge Davis Century Ride, Davis, CA, June 2012 (link) My primary goal is to participate in the LiveSTRONG Challenge in Davis California on June 24, 2012. I am planning to attempt the 100 mile ride that hot day in June, in order to do this, I have a lot of training to do. As part of the LiveSTRONG Challenge I am working to raise money to raise awareness and fight cancer, it hit close to home in 2011 as my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer. You can donate to my fund raising at https://laf. livestrong. org/goto/chrishammond I appreciate any and all donations, no matter how large or small! If you are interested in riding with me (please do) you can join Team DotNetNuke for the challenge, even if you don't want to ride the 100 mile ride, you can do a shorter distance as part of the challenge. Wine Country Metric Century, Santa Rosa, CA May 2012 (link) In May of 2012 I plan to partake tin the Wine Country Century (metric) put on by the Santa Rosa Cycling Club. I hope that this will be right in line with my LiveSTRONG training, 62 miles on a Saturday in early May. Registration for this opens in February 2012, so hopefully I can get in as there is a limit to the number of registrants. Tierra Bella 2012 60k, Gilroy, CA April 2012 (link) As prep for the above to events I hope to take part in the 60k route of the 2012 Tierra Bella bike ride put on by the Almaden Cycle Touring Club near Gilroy California. This will be around 35 miles. Registration is open, though I haven't yet registered as I am waiting to see if my wife is going to participate in this as well. Marin Triathlon (sprint), Marin County, CA, November 2012 (link) To close out the year, I am planning to participate in my first triathlon. I'm not a runner, not really a fan of it, I used to swim a lot as a kid, so I am hoping that with the riding to get ready for the LiveSTRONG Challenge I will manage to get in shape enough that I can take part in and complete my first sprint triathlon. My wife is also likely going to do this one as well. Following my goals? Well, you can follow my rides and stats by checking out my Strava. com profile. I'll be doing another writeup here in the next week on strava. com and why I think it is the best website for tracking rides, and even finding new ones. I just signed up for it about a week ago, and I am totally addicted to it now. Stay tuned for that post. "

    "title": "Cuban Gravel Crisis Ride Review",
    "body": "2019/10/23 -  October 2019 brought gravel weather to the Midwest, and the first big event of the season was the Cuban Gravel Crisis, in Cuba, Missouri on October 12th. This year the ride started in Hood Park, which is where the Crawford County fair is held. I realized once we got there that I had been there, almost 20 years ago, shooting photos at a concert for a local band from Cuba called N2Versatle. The CGC offered 3 ride lengths, 100/50/25, with the 100 starting at 7am and the 50/25 starting at 9am. I met the posse at CrossFit Wildwood and we headed down together in the Tahoe. This ride brought together the DK100 (Steve and Lybarger) crew and added in the mustached wonder of Wagner, we were team 3 Chrises and a Steve. Cuba was just over an hour away from the gym, so it was an easy drive down 44, a road so familiar from my many trips to/from Rolla for school years ago (I met n2Versatle as a DJ at the college radio station back in the day). We knew going into the ride that it was going to be a cold one, with start time forecasts showing 32-34 degrees. What we were not prepared for was how cold that would be! While waiting in line for the check in we quickly were brought up to speed on what Winter is like, because we had forgotten&hellip;. Missouri skipped Fall for a weekend, though&nbsp; now, two weeks later the weather was finally back into fall mode, today however it is going to get up towards 70. At check in we received our packages, which contained a bib number and timing chip. I mistakenly removed my timing chip, assuming that I needed to put it on my helmet, before realizing they had stabled the chip to the number so that we didn't need to mount it externally. We headed to the only warm place on site, the restroom, and prepped before getting the bikes ready. I've really taken to utilizing the Chamois Butter this year. With that, in combination with my new Specialized Power Expert saddle from Trailhead earlier this year, my riding has never been more comfortable! Bike prep was pretty straight forward, get your bottles together, computer turned on, air in the tires. The real prep was clothing! I was wearing my Pearl Izumi thermal full length bib, wool socks, and a long sleeve Hincapie jersey. On my head I wore a PI head band to cover my ears, and threw on a Maxxis neck gaiter I got at Dirty Kanza this year. On my hands I wore a pair of warmer Craft gloves, and had those inserted into my bar mitts I had installed the night before on the Niner RLT. The Bar Mitts, holy cow, I can't recommend them enough. After about 15 miles I had to take my gloves off and go with a much thinner pair, because the combo of the Craft gloves and bar mitts were causing my hands to be downright hot. Caution on the bar mitts though. They can be cumbersome, and get in the way. They limit your grip options on a drop bar bike, leaving you unable to access the drops, but in cold weather, they are totally worth it. The ride started by heading out of hood park on an old gravel road following the train tracks that runs along side of Historic Route 66. The start felt a little unorganized, it was hard to hear the announcers due to the size of the crowd and distance from the PA, but once on the road things started to spread out. The road was marked with painted arrows, which worked out well for the most part, with only a couple of minor problems for people who either couldn't get their route isnto their bike computer (looking at you Wagner) or people who missed the arrows when marked poorly (also looking at you Wagner).  For the most part, the three Chrises rode in the near vicinity of each other all day, while Steve was a little further back riding his mountain bike with MTB tires mounted, instead of his gravel tires. We all stopped at the rest stop around mile 15 in Steeleville, and then again around mile 25 when Wagner hit a gravel pothole that helped to alleviate the air from the tire on his ride. He quickly popped the tube off of the rim of the bike, to discover that the sealant used on his tubeless setup had turned into Loctite for the nut holding his valve stem in. He was going to pop a tube in and keep riding. We should have simply tried filling it up with air, before popping the bead on the tire. We spent the next 28 minutes trying to figure out how to get the nut off the valve stem. We asked every rider who went by if they had a pair of pliers, no one did. No one had a Leatherman, we were stuck. Mike Weiss from Bike Shark Bicycle Company stopped with an old car racing friend of mine, Bryan. Mike and Bryan both attempted to get the nut off, to no avail as well. Until finally a rider stopped, he had acquired a new tool the prior week, and while it wasn't exactly pliers, it was close enough to pliers that Mike was able to get the nut free. Wagner threw a tube in the tire, pumped it back up and we were on our way again. Not long after the tire change, we county road E, which lead us down towards Cave Rd, which was going to be a quite the climb, followed by a jaunt through Onandaga Cave State Park, another location I visited 20 years ago (to the month) for the wedding of a pair of friends. These two climbs were tough, but they had to be done if we wanted to finish the ride, so we pushed through and rode on. Shortly after Onandaga, Wagner pulled away from myself and Lybarger as he is always much stronger on the hills than I am. Lybarger and I knew there was a rest stop coming up near Leasburg, but we weren't quite sure how far away it was. We ended up stopping about 1/4 mile beforehand to take a break and refuel, only to find the stop shortly there after and take another break. We almost missed the turn for the stop as the only marking I saw was on the left, on the inside of the left hand turn, thankfully my navigation was working. Unfortunately for Wagner, he missed this turn and end up with an extra 4 miles before the rest stop outside of Leasburg. After the rest stop, I was feeling extra lethargic and Lybarger headed off ahead of me. We both knew we were close, within the last 12 or 13 miles. Those are always the worst, the final slog, when the body wants you to stop, but you keep telling it that you are almost done and can rest later. Coming into the finish, much later than initially planned, both due to the 30 minute mechanical, and more so due to the 5k feet of climbing that the route had, was a welcome experience. The crowds of my last couple of bigger rides (DK and Pedal The Cause) were non-existent, but the finish was just as nice. &nbsp; I came through and immediately rode back to the Tahoe to get off the bike. Lybarger came over, with food in hand and pointed me towards a tent and food truck parked not too far away. I walked over to those to see what sustenance I could find. I found some pork sliders for $2 a pop, I got 2, and a soda from the food truck next door. Not the biggest meal, but enough to hold me over as I waited for Wagner and Steve to finish their rides. When they were finished we quickly loaded up and hit the road back to St. Louis. I had to get home to some family things, so we couldn't stick around, and didn't even have time to stop anywhere on the way home to grab some food. Overall this event was great. Beautiful route, HOLY HILLS there was a lot of elevation. Definitely a ride to look forward to again in 2020!  "

Ranging in Elevation from 321 feet to 4,809 feet for the century. Depending on the distance you sign up for, and when you sign up, you commit to raising a certain level of funds. Riding the Century route, and registering before July 1st, I committed to raising at least $600, had I signed up after July 1st, I would have needed to commit to $1,000. In previous years I had ran on the Team ASG-SPS team, but this year I changed things up. I wanted to try to put together a team for the gym we go to, so I started the CrossFit Wildwood team. We had 7 members total on the team, 2 other members from CrossFit Wildwood, 2 members from the ASG-SPS team, and my kids signed up for the team challenge. We set a team goal of raising $5,000, which I'll be honest, a few weeks ago, it seemed like we wouldn't get anywhere close to that goal. But as of right now, we have $4,695, and I believe we have another $2,000 coming in from a fund raising event we held with the St. Louis Region SCCA Solo program back on the 22nd of September. I haven't figured out what will happen with the team next year, if I can get a few more CrossFit Wildwood members to join the team and ride, we will&nbsp; keep it going, otherwise might just switch back to the ASG-SPS team with Dave and Beth. So how did Sunday go? Well, it was both WET and HOT. The morning started out with wet roads from a morning shower that came through before the start of the ride. It didn't rain too much, if at all, during the ride, but much of the roads were wet throughout the day. You had to breath through your nose while you were riding as to not collect/drink spray from the rider in front of you, and at each rest stop you needed to clean your glasses. The morning started out very humid in the mid 70s, and only went UP from there. It ultimately got HOT. So hot that they actually closed down a section of the course, the Babler Beast, the inner loop around Babler State Park. I started the ride with Aaron, riding with the Stifel team, but also a member at CrossFit Wildwood. We took off at a decent clip, but started towards the back of the group, so we couldn't totally gun it to try to stay with the fastest riders. Through Chesterfield Valley I feel like we could of used a larger pack for more speed, but we kept up a good clip and had a great conversation along the way. We skipped the first aid station at the Taubman outlets, and kept pedaling to get to the other side of the valley to stop at the aid station at the John L. LeCave Memorial Trailhead at the end of the Monarch Levy Trail. If I recall correctly, this was about mile 24 into the ride. Here I refilled a bottle with Gatorade, took a shot of pickle juice and had a half a PB&amp;J sandwich. From there we headed out towards Wildhorse Creek and then up Ossenfort. I told Aaron not to worry about waiting for me, as much riding as I've done this year, I feel like my hill climbing hasn't been very good, so I figured he would be much faster up the hills and I wouldn't see him again. I am pleased to say I kept up with him for the first two hills, Ossenfort and Little Tavern. Once we got up to Hencken though, I was cooked and he was much faster. We met back up at the aid station in Greensfelder, and headed south on Allenton together. The loop south of 44 in Eureka is a pretty rough road, and steep climb to start, at this point I lost sight of Aaron and would only see him at two more rest stops going forward. Going up this first hill south of 44 I got really upset. I was climbing along, struggling, and I hear what I thought was a car behind me, I even started to yell  car back  to the riders ahead of me when I turned and saw an older gentleman cruising up and past me on his e-bike. This triggered me, here I was struggling, and here goes this guy just casually pedaling along, assisted, with ease. I really wasn't mad at him, but I was upset with jealousy. Later in the day, when he passed me 3 or 4 more times going up different hills, that's when I started to get upset. Good for him, he's out riding. But man, if you're going to pass a slow guy on climbs with your e-bike, stay in front of him so you don't have to insult him EVERY DAMN HILL there is. At the top of Allenton I stopped at the Greensfelder aid station again and went to the bike mechanic for some lube. My chain was loud as could be, and I hoped they could help me. I don't know why I put dry lube on the bike two nights before, at the Hermann Gravel challenge I learned that the dry lube comes right off in the wet conditions and makes a hell of a racket when it does. I was able to get some lube and the bad sounds went away for the rest of the day. From Greensfelder (the second time) you head back to Melrose, down and then up through Rockwoods Reservation back up to Old Manchester. Old Manchester goes west back out to Melrose and up to where Ossenfort and Melrose meet. At this point I stopped to rest in the shade a bit and chat with another gym Member, Beahm, who was volunteering at the aid station. I questioned his choice in Music, the guy must be late 20s, MAYBE early 30s, but he's rocking classic rock like it is going out of style. He must of been raised here in St. Louis listening to KSHE through his youth instead of 105. 7 The Point. From there you head down Ossenfort, which is always questionable when wet, by this point in the afternoon many of the shaded roads were still wet, even though the heat was climbing. My Garmin recorded a 99 degree temperature reading around there. From the base of Ossenfort it was down towards Highway T. This section of the ride, in the past, always sucks. You are completely exposed, no shade, going up an incline back towards Highway 100. For some reason, 2019 was different. I felt revived on this stretch of road and managed to pass two riders ahead of me and get across 100 and back on to Old Manchester in record time (for me). It was still sunny, and hot, but it didn't drain me along Highway T like I expected. Then it was a run east on Old Manchester to Pond, out to Babler State Park. I was definitely getting hot, and not pushing for any PRs along this section of the route. I was looking forward to Babler, because the aid station there typically has orange bandanas sitting in a cooler full of ice water, and on a hot day, these bandanas go a long way to making you feel cooler/better. I arrived at Babler, with the intention of grabbing an ice cold bandana, and then heading into the park for the  Babler Beast , a counter clockwise loop of the park with a hell of a climb towards the end. Unfortunately when I asked for a bandana, I was told they didn't have any, and offered a cold paper towel. I said I would just grab one on the way back through, after doing the loop, but was quickly told that they had closed the part of the course in the park. Due to heat and injuries, they shut it down. I honestly was not too thrilled with this news. I have been training for Pedal The Cause all year, with the intention of finishing the full ride this year, something I've only done once previously. I wasn't about to let this stop me, so I headed up the chute to where the close was closed, and I just went. They chased me, they yelled, they event sent a police helicopter, but I went anyways. I ended up completing the loop, in probably one of my slowest times ever, but I completed it. I was definitely hot at this point, so I made sure to take my time, and rested before going up the big climb. As I was going up the climb, I decided to stop and take two breaks, instead of stopping and walking, I let my heart rate come back down and relaxed. I also didn't want to overheat and need medical assistance, especially after I went against the ride's wishes, so I took my time, and I made my way around Babler State Park. When I stopped to rest at the Babler aid station again I noticed that two other riders came in behind me, also deciding to take to the closed section of the course. I ran into Steve at this point, who unfortunately told me he was experiencing cramping issues again. Wasn't much I could offer him, so I went ahead and&nbsp; left Babler and headed out for what I knew would be the worst part of the course. For me the last 20 miles of Pedal the cause every year is the worst. You have one hill, Reiger, which isn't too bad, then you head down Wildhorse, a steep descent and then follow along the creek for 3-4 miles. After that you head down to Centaur and back to the LeCave trailhead. This section of the road isn't too bad, but when you're doing it solo you just want to be done. I'm typically riding this section of road with other riders, but for Pedal I always seem to be by myself, so it gets lonely to run by yourself. After the aid station at Centaur, you head down the Levy trail and then through Chesterfield Valley back up a climb on Baxter to the amphitheater. The first 3 miles on the Levy trail were great, the wind was at my back, and my riding was quick, After passing under the Boone bridge you go east, RIGHT INTO A DAMN HEADWIND (it was actually from the southeast, so&hellip; it go worse). I lost 6mph on my speed into this wind, and I was going to be heading east/southeast the rest of the ride. This is where I broke. I simply couldn't keep any speed up, my motivation was sapped. I wasn't about to give up on the ride, but my pedaling slowed, and I was passed by 3 individuals within the last 1/2 mile of the finish. 98. 24 miles according to my Garmin After the ride I had intentions of grabbing Sugarfire BBQ, but I was completely spent. I grabbed two bottles of Propel from the cheer/dance team handing out medals and water at the finish, found some shade and laid down for 20 minutes to recover. A big thank you to everyone who rode this year, volunteered this year, and anyone who donated to any pedal the cause rider or team. Aaron finished his first century, by riding some extra distance afterwards to get to the full 100 miles. Dave finished 73 miles, cutting out some of the course due to the conditions. Steve unfortunately had to get the SAG wagon back to the event start, seccumbing to the cramps. Now it is back to Gravel season. I'll be getting my Niner RLT setup this week and will be back on gravel roads to get ready for the Cuban Gravel Crisis coming up in less than two weeks. "

Isn't Toddler366 enough for you Chris? No, it isn't. So what is 30 Days of Biking? Well, plain and simple, bicycling at least once, every day, in April 2012. Why? Why not. Biking is good for you, the more you do it, the better you feel, the better shape you are in. How much will you be riding? That depends on my schedule. Some days it will just be a quick ride around the neighborhood, some days I'll get in multiple rides. Hopefully every day I will get at least one ride in though, even if it is short. The difficult part for me is that I am likely going to be travelling to the east coast at the end of the month, and getting a ride in with that may prove hard, though I may try to ride a couple of times, even if short, with my good buddy Stephen Jones from www. velonation. com, but we'll see how that comes along. With each ride, assuming I ride with my Garmin, I will post up my Strava report from the ride. So here is Day 1's ride.  Yesterday morning we headed off to REI to see what we might find at the Garage Sale. We didn't plan on buying anything, but we had never been, so we went with open minds. Well, we scored. We ended up getting the iBert Safe-T-Seat Front Child Seat (Green,38-Pounds limit) for a steal, really, too low to even post about here! We immediately went home and tried putting it on my Cannondale Quick CX 1, unfortunately it wouldn't work on that bike, so we tried it on Natalie's Quick CX 3 and it did work. Jacqueline loves it! As you can see in the photo at the top of the post. "

    "body": "2012/01/10 - As I get more and more into cycling I am looking for more and more things to get my cycling. I live in Half Moon Bay, and while my wife has started to ride as well, it is hard for us to get out for long rides because we have a 15 month old baby (15 months today!, happy 15 months Jacqueline). While we get out occasionally with the baby in tow, we typically each ride solo. In that quest to find riding events and people to ride with, etc I stumbled on SF2G, a club (website) for people in the bay area looking for others to ride with. I believe it started out as a way to get people to ride their bikes from San Francisco City to Google, by some Google employees. It has grown into 1800+ members and a variety of different rides, along with members from a wide range of companies and locations. Every first Friday of the month they do a First Friday Friendly Frolic (FFFF) in which they go with a No Rider Left Behind policy. They leave from a designated location and head south on the  BayWay  which primarily covers the bayside trail, and the necessary side streets in order to make it all the way down to the Google offices and various others. I am going to try to ride with them starting this February, though in order for me to do this I am going to have to do things a little out of the ordinary. I don't have the legs (yet) to ride from Half Moon Bay to my office in San Mateo, much less up to the starting point for FFFF, so I am going to drive up to the Daly City Bart station, then ride Bart up to wherever I need to go to meet up with FFFF. Then ride along until Foster City, at which point I will jump off and head west to the DotNetNuke offices. This is a little backwards, out of the way, but it is something I feel like I should try to do. Then hopefully, after work, I can ride my back to the Milbrae Bart station, and then catch that back to Daly City to get my car. "

    "body": "2011/07/17 -  So this isn’t going to be a long tip, as this topic will likely fill out future tips as well, but for now I will raise a question. How do you track your rides? Or, do you track your rides? At this point in time I use Garmin Connect and SportstrackLive. com. Why do I use both? Well I have a Garmin Forerunner 305 that I use, mounted to the handlebars on the bike, with a heart rate monitor and cadence monitor. It tracks things rather well, bit I figure having two sources of data can’t hurt. For SportstrackLive I use my Motorola Droid, running Android 2. 2. 2. SportstrackLive works alright, though I haven’t bothered to get any attachments for it (heart rate, or cadence). I find that I like the Garmin website interface better than STL, but to be honest, both of them leave me wanting more. I feel like I should get more out of the websites. Neither of them seem to provide me anything along the lines of “hey someone else rides the same place you do”. Being that my wife and I are just getting into the bicycling thing, I wonder if riding would be more interesting (not that it isn’t right now) if we rode with other people? Someone to push/pull us along? Watching the Tour this year, I’ve seen plenty of advertisements for MapMyRide, but I’ve yet to try the software out yet. Anyone have any experience/opinion on it? I do find that having the data drives me to ride more. I like being able to run reports on my riding to see that I’ve put in 161 miles since May 1st. "
