    "title": "The 2021 Big and Little Sugar Gravel Ride Review",
    "body": "2021/10/25 - Where to start on this one, it’s been an interesting year, not the best to be honest with a variety of things causing turmoil this year, I question how much I want to, or should share, so we’ll see what comes out in this post. First and foremost, to the family that experienced tragedy this weekend, I am so sorry for your loss. For the rest of the weekend and ride review: Monday morning I texted my buddy Wagner (Wags) to tell him I was out, I would not be going to Bentonville for Big Sugar Gravel. I had spent a few days fighting a sinus infection (I am vaccinated and tested negative for covid, though I was pretty sure before the test that it was a usual for me sinus thing). I had only been on my bike once in October, and was simply not ready to try to ride 100 miles in North West Arkansas and South West Missouri. He let me stew on the message I sent him for a bit then suggested we could still do the 50 mile ride, the Little Sugar. By early afternoon that simple reply from him had flipped my mindset. We went out for a ride that afternoon and I was back in the game, though with an adjusted plan to ride 50 miles and still be back home in St. Louis Saturday night so I could go to my daughter’s gymnastics competition on Sunday. Friday morning we left St. Louis County arriving in Bentonville shortly after 1pm. We went to the 8th Street Market to figure out where Outerbike was, and to grab some lunch before registration was supposed to open. At registration we were easily able to switch our entries from Big Sugar to Little Sugar, and I got a thank you from Treva for letting them know about a bridge that was out on the 100 mile route.  Side Note: So this trip was not my first to Bentonville, I had actually been down there for the first time one week prior, meeting with a potential customer about a software project. On my drive back, last Friday the 15th, I decided to cruise along some of the gravel roads to see what we were in for. I wasn’t more than a mile off the highway when I came across a closed road, which I knew from looking at the Ride With GPS map was part of the route for Big Sugar. I drove down the closed road (don’t try this at home kids) and came across a crew working feverishly on a bridge. Before I got home on Friday I reached out to the LifeTime crew to ask if they knew about the bridge. They reached out on Monday and made sure to get out and check it out. In their defense, they had recently covered the course, but the bridge was damaged sometime after that scouting run.  From there we walked around Outerbike. I must admit, the Dirty Kanza/Unbound Gravel expo puts all other expos at events (besides my one trip to Sea Otter) to shame. I was kind of expecting Outerbike to compete, but it was much smaller. It was most definitely there for the MTB crew, and while the Gravel folks were accepted, the focus was on mountain bikes and demos, primarily. That being said, we picked up a number of swag items, including waffles from both Untapped and Honeystinger. Wags found and geeked out with Jom from GravelCyclist. Another local, Adelmann, from St. Louis showed up at the expo, so we organized a brief afternoon ride. He wanted to check out the beginning of the course, and I was really more interested in trying to see some of Bentonville and some of the trails. Wags and I ended up heading up towards the Slaughter Pen trail, which also happened to be the finish area for both Big and Little Sugar. We headed off into some single track on our gravel steeds and had a blast trying not to injure ourselves before Saturday. From there we headed out the road up and under the highway. We ended up only putting in about 10. 5 miles, but it was enough to get our legs moving a bit and see some of Bentonville. We stopped at the Phat Bike shop and eached picked up a t-shirt, while I picked up some new cleats for my shoes thinking that my old ones were wearing out (they weren’t, the new ones felt just as loose as the old ones).  Saturday morning we checked out of the hotel and headed up to find a parking spot. We ended up parking near the Square in Bentonville, which worked out fricken amazingly. There was a public bathroom right there, and we were 1 block from the finish line so that after the ride we could easily get the bikes back on the rack and we could change clothes. We had hoped to make it to the start line for the 7am Big Sugar start, to see Adelmann off, but ended up not making it down there until closer to 720am.  The start was at the Momentary, which to be honest, is a cool looking building, but I have no idea what it actually is, the assumption is it is some sort of art space. (Runs off to google: The Momentary brings together contemporary visual, performing, and culinary arts into a welcoming, communal space in Northwest Arkansas. ) The Little Sugar ride went off right as scheduled at 8am with a lead out of town, we were back far enough that we couldn’t see the lead, but I believe it was local police doing the work on that. Before too long we were on Gravel and off into the beautiful country known as North West Arkansas (and southwest Missouri).  There was a threat of rain, but that didn’t materialize. We did get a pretty scary looking storm at the rest stop, to the north of there it was dark and the wind started blowing pretty good for a bit, but for use on the Little Sugar course we remained dry with only a couple of seconds of spitting drops here or there.  The course itself was amazing, hilly but the hills were not TOO much. I did get off and walk on a couple of those hills however. I was able to hop back on and finish the climbs each time I did though. We made it to the the aid station at Whistling Springs Brewery without any noticeable trouble, though neither Wags nor I drank enough fluids in that first 2 hours on the ride. I chugged a bottle of Scratch that I had to try to force fluids in me and then grabbed some water at the brewery to fill both bottles back up. The aid station was stocked with Untapped Maple products, as well as other assorted items. I tried their “MapleAid” which I pictured as lemonade, had someone told me it was Tea I might have taken to it better, but expecting lemonade with maple flavor, I quickly poored out the sample that I had put in my bottle and just grabbed water instead. Wags went inside and grabbed himself a beer, as we all had “drink” tickets that we could use there. I grabbed some snacks and looked around a bit. With the storm appearing to be moving our way, I wasn’t too intersted in standing around, but I did get to see some of the beautiful property there, including a pig and dog wandering around saying hello to people. To get out of the brewery you climb up Whistling Springs road, I was chugging along the climb when I decided to stand up and put a little effort into it. This caused my rear tire to lose traction, my foot to immediately fall down to the bottom of my stroke, a quick unclip and I was hoofing it for a little while up the hill. It was shortly after leaving the brewery that we came across a maroon Toyota Tacoma, first coming at us, then after it turned around, it passed us going back the way from which it came. Not a minute or two later and we came across the same Tacoma stopped in the middle of the road, we could see a rider down in front of the truck. I immedatiately jumped off my bike, called 911 and began trying to figure out where we actually were so that we could get help to us. For now, for the families sake, I will leave out any additional details, if anyone from the family would like more info, please feel free to contact me. Wags and I stayed on the scene for about 45 minutes, before heading back out on the road. On the way out the ambulance was coming in, we were glad to see that.   The rest of the ride kind of blurs together, at one point Wags and I were talking about how we hadn’t had any of the 100 mile competitors pass us since the accident (maybe 15 came through while we were there, a BIG thank you to those who slowed down, to those of you who didn’t, a couple of the top 5 men’s riders, show some decency next time). We began to wonder if the organizers had closed the course at the Brewery for weather or something. It wasn’t until shortly after this conversation that we started to get riders coming by us from the 100, we found out later talking to a gentleman who finished in the 21st spot that they had actually shut the course down where the ambulance arrived on the scene.  Once the trickle started as 100 mile riders were passing us, the flood came. Mostly we were passed by the top men, but a number of women passed by as well, including Amity Rockwell. A big shout out to all the riders who passed us slower guys with words of encouragement, it was much appreciated each and every time someone said something. The finish required you to climb back up into the park area around the start of Slaughter Pen, you were on paved roads at this point, but was a slog for someone who wasn’t in shape and ready for a 50 mile ride. Wags waited for me and helped motivate me towards the finish as we crossed the line together, 5 hours and 21 minutes after we started, in 254th and 255th spot. I definitely had hoped to finish this ride in under 5 hours, hoping for closer to 4 hours, but with over 3k feet of elevation, and stopping for 45 minutes to assist, I am please that we still finished in 5:21. Post ride you were given a mug/mason jar of Untapped Maple syrup and a bike ole lollipop (lots of SUGAR). Wags and I headed back to the car, loaded up the bikes and changed into some street clothign to be comfortable before heading back to the finish area to grab food from a food truck with our meal tickets. We sat down and talked to a few fellow competitors, and I chatted with Big Tall Wayne again (Wags and I spoke to him Friday at the 8th street market, as well as at Unbound earlier this year). Adelmann wandered up to us after he finished and he downed a bottle of my Scratch Labs drink that I had made while at the truck. He was struggling with nutritional issues and said he was fortunate to have finished having vision concerns the last ~30 miles of his ride. He averaged 14. 98mph on his ride, while Wagner and I averaged 9. 94mph. Strava Ride I got all sorts of comments on my jersey for the ride on Saturday. I wore my 2019 Cuban Gravel Crisis jersey. That WAS a real ride, and I gotta say, the best named gravel race in the history of gravel races. Unfortunately I hear rumors that the organizer of the ride no longer has rights to the name and is changing the name going forward, that’s unfortunate (looks like they let the domain expire even, that’s a shame)! If you’ve not made your way to North West Arkansas yet, definitely check it out. Bentonville, you are amazing. See you soon, next time my family is coming too. Be sure to check out BigSugarGravel. com for information on when registration will open for next year, you don’t want to miss this event! A big thanks goes out to the event organizers, and to the folks at LifeTime for reaching out on Sunday as well. My thoughts again go out to the family. "

View Photos   The Review: Two Years ago I was in Emporia Kansas for the Dirty Kanza, riding 100 miles on gravel for the first time. It wasn't easy, I was slow, and spent most of the second half helping a buddy get through the ride while he was having some serious cramping. Overall we had a great weekend of riding and I made it a point to try to get back. I made that easier by attending the Lunar Kanza in July 2019 and obtaining a lotto bypass for 2020. As for everyone, 2020 didn't go as planned, I did get a lot of riding in, but I wasn't going to be ready for 200 miles if it had happened. Earlier this year I failed to start training/riding early, and ultimately spent about 2 months dealing with some heart issues where I wasn't on the bike at all.  Because of all that, I had to defer my 2021 entry to 2022 for the Unbound Gravel event. I already had a hotel room and wanted to be in Emporia to experience the fun that comes with the event so myself and Wagner (Wags) headed on down anyways. We signed up to volunteer to work 10 hours so that we could ensure that Wags got in for 2022, and hopefully bring my brother or another friend along with us too based on my hours worked. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Tahoe-800-26986e255. jpg” alt=”“The Tweeting Tahoe Loaded Up”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Tahoe-400-26986e255. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Tahoe-600-26986e255. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Tahoe-800-26986e255. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Tahoe-1000-26986e255. jpg 1000w”&gt; We headed down on Thursday afternoon so that we could make a quick pass through the expo before it closed down that evening. The drive down from St. Louis was uneventful, unlike our drive down in 2019, we did see a couple of gravel bikes on racks on the way west. We arrived in Emporia shortly before 6pm. Once there we walked around the All Things Gravel Expo, checked out Gravel City and their shop and headed over to our hotel to get checked in to the Econo Lodge. While the Econo Lodge was cheap, and overall it was comfortable, we were severly disappointed the first night when we walked up to the second floor and it reeked of cigarette smoke and beer. Ultimately the hotel worked out okay, I think the guys who were smoking/drinking were workers and Friday they headed back to their homes for the weekend. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/GravelEnds-800-f4af66f67. jpg” alt=”“Friday Morning Ride”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/GravelEnds-400-f4af66f67. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/GravelEnds-600-f4af66f67. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/GravelEnds-800-f4af66f67. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/GravelEnds-1000-f4af66f67. jpg 1000w”&gt; Friday morning we got up and headed back in to town, parking in the same lot from the night before. We took off on our bikes and rode the 25 mile route before we needed to be at our first volunteer assignment. The riding was great, it was definitely starting to warm up and we were thankful that we got the ride in early and that we would be  working  inside at the packet pickup area. We made another pass through the expo before work where Wags ran into a childhood friend he raced BMX with in St. Louis. In the Expo I saw Frankie Andreu and got introduced to Tinker Jaurez, BMX legend. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/FrankieAndTinker-800-8ce341d0c. jpg” alt=”“Frankie Andreu and Tinker Juarez”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/FrankieAndTinker-400-8ce341d0c. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/FrankieAndTinker-600-8ce341d0c. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/FrankieAndTinker-800-8ce341d0c. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/FrankieAndTinker-1000-8ce341d0c. jpg 1000w”&gt; We checked in with the volunteer coordinator and I spent the next 3. 5 hours handing out T-Shirts to mostly 200 mile riders, but a few 100 riders as well. I got to hand a shirt to Ashton Lamby and Amity Rockwell among many others. Wags was passing out bags during that time and got to give a bag to both of those riders as well. He also talked to Jeremiah about the Impossible Route. After working we made another pass through the Expo to grab any additional swag we had missed. As a Vegan (almost 1. 5 year now) I was worried about what I might find to food. At Gravel City I saw a gentleman behind the counter with a tofu bowl, so I asked where he got it and he pointed me to Chi Em Eats, a vietnamese place just down the street. I ordered a bowl from them and picked it up, Wags grabbed another burrito from the food truck at the expo and we sat and talked to a few locals over dinner.  We had a great experience with every local we ran into in Emporia, they all appear to love the event and all the people it brings into town. We even ran into a guy an hour out of town when filling up with gas that was happy we were heading down.  Saturday morning we got up early and headed north to Alma where we would be spending the morning working the first checkpoint on the 200 mile route. Most of my time there was spent directing/holding traffic at the one flashing light in town, stopping traffic when any riders were coming through, and letting the traffic through at appropriate times. Almost every one of those we had to stop was pleasant and supportive, though I do recall one truck that wasn't too happy about having to take 30 seconds out of his day to sit there. While in Alma I got to spend some time walking around with my camera, getting some photos of the leaders of the 200 coming through, and then various other riders coming through, getting service, and heading out of town, you can see those linked here. After our volunteer time in Alma, Wags and I were starving, so we grabbed lunch at the local mexican joint before heading back towards Emporia. We were exhausted, and initially planned to head back to the hotel and rest of before heading back into the fun of the finish area. On the way down we checked the results and noticed that the leaders from the 200 race were just getting through Council Grove, this caused us to divert west over to Americus so that we could sit on the side of the road and get some photos and cheer people along. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/BoswellandTenDam-800-1b29dd631. jpg” alt=”“Ian Boswell and Laurens ten Dam at Unbound Gravel 200”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/BoswellandTenDam-400-1b29dd631. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/BoswellandTenDam-600-1b29dd631. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/BoswellandTenDam-800-1b29dd631. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/BoswellandTenDam-1000-1b29dd631. jpg 1000w”&gt; &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/TedKing-800-b4221fd82. jpg” alt=”“Ted King Unbound Gravel 200”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/TedKing-400-b4221fd82. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/TedKing-600-b4221fd82. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/TedKing-800-b4221fd82. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/TedKing-1000-b4221fd82. jpg 1000w”&gt; We got to see the top 5 200 mile riders pass by, and a number of 100 mile riders before we headed back into town. Later that evening we went back out to the finish area, I really wanted to try to get a selfie with Alison Tetrick to go with the one I got with her in 2019.      View this post on Instagram      A post shared by Christopher Hammond (@thechristoc) From the finish line I wanted to see if we could get somewhere on course to try to get a good sunset shot with riders out on the course, and then some night sky photos out there as well, ideally with a rider or two. We headed west towards Lake Kahola, I remembered that area from my prior to rides there in Emporia, and I knew that some of the gravel roads out there might provide me a good place to shoot from. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Stars-800-8c795892f. jpg” alt=”“The Night Sky over Unbound Gravel”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Stars-400-8c795892f. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Stars-600-8c795892f. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Stars-800-8c795892f. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2021/Unbound2021/Stars-1000-8c795892f. jpg 1000w”&gt; I ended up not getting the great Night Sky shots that I wanted, but we did sit out on the course on a climb just before the 20 miles left point, where we cheered on riders until just after midnight. I took photos until I just couldn't get any decent ones in the dark, with a couple of night sky shots turning out. It was a somewhat cloudy night and more clouds definitely moved in the longer we sat there.  The riders that came by mostly appeared to be appreciative of our cheering at them. We found that they either were thankful, or zombie like (understandable after 180 miles). I never thought I would have so much fun at an event not riding, but Wags and I had a blast all weekend. Being there, cheering people on, encouraging them to keep going, taking photos, helping out, it was great. If you don't get into the Unbound Gravel event next year through the lottery, you absolutely should look at volunteering. This year the deal was that you had to work at least 10 hours to get a bypass for 2022, I would assume they will do something similar for 2023, you should consider this! It's a great intro to the Emporia atmosphere and gives you time to get out there on the course and get some rides in for you as well. Thanks to everyone within the LifeTime and Unbound organizations for a great weekend! See you next year, I'm planning on 200 miles, training started last month. "

    "body": "2021/03/15 - So what’d you do this past weekend? Did you ride The Mid South? They shifted things up this year, went to a virtual “incredibly socially distant” version of the event.  Everyone is getting 50% of their reg fee refunded starting today. It might take a few days to deposit so be patient!We are physically mailing out your Mid South swag bag with t-shirt, water bottle, and more to your front door! It will be there before event weekend. If you’re signed up for the race YOU’RE IN. All you will need to do moving forward is join the Ride With GPS challenge page and upload your ride/run. You must ride/run and record your activity on one of the dates between March 12-14. Our partner bike shops are creating 50k, 50mi, 100mi routes in their areas for many of you to be able to ride/run. Sponsors will be sending swag to each of these shops for you to win on a first come, first serve basis after you’ve completed their specific Mid South partner route. If you don’t live in one of the partner shop areas you can upload your own course/activity from your backyard to the Ride With GPS challenge page. You will not be able to win swag from the bike shops BUT you will be entered to win from a list of GRAND prizes. We will be drawing names from the complete list of all participants that uploaded their ride/run from the event weekend on Monday March 15th. Prizes include a Salsa Stormchaser, 5 free entries to Mid South 2022, free bike shipping to and from Mid South 2022 AND a free entry to thtruee race courtesy of Bike Flights, and our biggest prize of all the “Eternal Entry. ” It lasts forever. More details soon. I had intentions of training and riding locally here in St. Louis for this, but 2021 got in the way. First, I had motivation issues starting out the year. I think I’ve been on the trainer once in 2021. Then in February I apparently started experiencing Atrial Fibrillation. My heart rate has been f’d up since the morning of 2/19. I went to bed late, around 1am, and according to my Garmin Fenix my heart rate has been f’d up ever since. I’ve got an appointment for a procedure tomorrow that will hopefully reset my heart rhythm that will hopefully get me back to normal and get me out on the bike again. The Mid South 2022 will be March 11th and 12th, 2022. Registration for that will open in October. They had a Facebook Live stream today after the weekend and awarded some prizes. The coolest being the Eternal Entry. Basically a free liftime entry to The Mid South. There’s a catch though. It has to be used every year or it goes away. It CAN be passed on though. It’ll be cool to see that get tracked, will the same person use it every year? Will someone different get to use it every year? "

    "body": "2020/10/29 - Hot off the presses, Dirty Kanza is no more, long may those who are unchained live Unbound!&nbsp; &nbsp; FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Contact: Jordan Titus | jtitus@lt. life | 218. 780. 6161 &nbsp; Life Time Reveals New Brand for Emporia Gravel&nbsp; Event: UNBOUND Gravel Internationally renowned for the remote, rugged and unforgiving journey it provides riders, the former DK gravel event begins a new chapter in 2021 &nbsp; EMPORIA, Kans. , October 30, 2020&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Life Time&nbsp;is&nbsp;pleased to announce the new name for its wildly popular Emporia, Kans. -based gravel event. &nbsp;UNBOUND Gravel&nbsp;will carry on the 15-year history, legacy and energy of the original event with a new identity. Garmin will remain on as title sponsor of the event. &nbsp; &quot;Our team agreed that we wanted a name, logo and colors that embody the Flint Hills of Kansas. This region, and the hilly, sharp gravel roads that accompany it, are what help make this event what it has become: known widely today as the World&rsquo;s Premier Gravel Event. We know the life impact this event has on people and we wanted a strong brand that participants felt proud of, that we could tell stories around, and that tied literally and figuratively to the area,&quot; said Michelle Duffy, Director of Off-Road Events Marketing at Life Time. &quot;The word UNBOUND most literally means to be free. It represents the free-range cattle, wild mustangs and native bison in the prairie of the Flint Hills, who move freely and live wildly. It&rsquo;s synonymous with our participants who experience a sense of freedom on the gravel roads outside of Emporia, and in those moments feel &ldquo;unbound&rdquo; from anything else. Just the rider and the tire-shredding, sun-baking, breathtaking Flint Hills gravel. &rdquo; &nbsp; In support of the new name and branding process, Life Time established a task force composed of Emporia business and tourism leaders, representatives of the cycling media, members of the cycling community&mdash;including a past champion and a two-time podium finisher&mdash;alongside its internal brand and marketing leaders. Additionally, other members of the gravel cycling community, along with partners and athletes, and a survey of many members of the DK community were instrumental in validating that &lsquo;UNBOUND Gravel&rsquo; meets the event&rsquo;s future vision. Finally, members of the Emporia-based events team visited Kaw Nation, Okla. to visit with members of the Tribal Council to openly discuss the renaming of the event and share the planned path forward. &nbsp; &ldquo;This rebrand is the end of a chapter for us as the DK, but we&rsquo;ll continue to embrace the history of the land on which we ride. We hope that each time riders touch the gravel roads in the Flint Hills, they take a moment to remember what has been,&rdquo; said Kristi Mohn, UNBOUND Gravel Marketing Manager. &ldquo;UNBOUND Gravel provides an opportunity to reimagine what an event&nbsp;can look like, and this rebrand is only step one in the process. So much is yet to come for the gravel community. &rdquo; &nbsp; In keeping with the establishment of its DEI Coalition, Life Time is committed to providing access and education to all individuals, while initiating industry shifts around inclusiveness at events. The organization has&nbsp;pledged to impact change across the industry&nbsp;as a whole, using its 30+ events as a platform. The team is taking deliberate steps to enact change for riders and runners across BIPOC, LGBTQ+, gender-focused, economically disenfranchised and para groups, including lowering the barrier of entry to the sport, providing access to start lines, gaining a clear understanding of who we are, so that we can identify and implement the work that must be done and evoking change to benefit the entire Life Time family of athletes, volunteers, partners, team members and the broader endurance sport community. &nbsp; Furthering the Company&rsquo;s commitment to the community, the event rebrand comes on the heels of the&nbsp;Life Time Foundation&nbsp;announcing a multi-year partnership with Emporia Public Schools, through which it has committed $95,000 in funding for a School Food Program that will impact more than 4,300 students across nine schools. &nbsp; The 2021 All Things Gravel Expo will kick off on June 3, with race day being Saturday, June 5. 2021 deferral registration will launch for participants with entry from the cancelled 2020 event on Monday, November 16.

    "title": "Katy Trail Trip 2020 Trip Report",
    "body": "2020/10/12 - 2020, the year that took away bicycle events, gravel rides, get togethers. The year that took away interactions with coworkers, friends, family. The year that took away jobs. 2020 is also the year that thousands of people purchased bicycles for the first time in a long time and started riding. Thousands of them out there, on the trails, some even on the streets. E-Bikes, mountain bikes, road bikes, cruisers, you name it, they are out there. We were out there with them. Originally fall 2020 was supposed to be consumed with the Pedal The Cause charity ride here in St. Louis, followed by the Cuban Gravel Crisis in Cuba, Missouri, and wrap up October with the Big Sugar Gravel ride in Bentonville, Arkansas. Well, all that got tossed out the window. With all the rides gone, we started planning our own adventure. Taking on the full 237 miles of the Katy Trail, for myself, again, and for Wagner and Luigi it would be their first time. We were the three bearded amigos. During initial planning we had upwards of 8 guys that were going to do the ride, but as we got into the month of August and I started pushing for people to commit, the numbers dwindled. Back at the beginning of September we did a shakedown ride to get gear tested out. We'll possibly do another post in the future on what gear we took/used/didn't need to carry, but I won't cover much of that in this writeup. Planned Route: Day 1: Clinton to Pilot Grove (60 miles)  Day 2: Pilot Grove to Portland (90 miles)  Day 3: Portland to Machens (90 miles) Planning out the ride we decided to do the same direction as three of us did back in 2017, West to East, starting in Clinton, MO and finishing in Machens, Mo. Why west to east? Three reasons: The wind typically blows west to east. The elevation on the Katy Trail is primarily on the western half, so get that out of the way earlier in the ride. We live near St. Louis, figuring we wouldn't want to do a 3-4 hour car drive after finishing, a 30-45 minute drive home is much more appealing. Originally we planned to do this over 4 days, not the aggressive three day ride like '17. The plan was to start late Thursday morning, finishing up late Sunday morning. That all changed a few times though, when we departed Clinton on Day 1 we had the above route in mind. &#160; Katy Trail Stats:  Direction: West to East Number of Days: 3 Dates: October 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 2020 Total Distance Rode: 249. 5 miles Total Time on Trail: 27 hours 48 minutes Total Moving Time: 19 hours 53 minutes Longest Day: Day 3 Shortest Day: Day 1 Max Speed: 25. 5mph Moving Average Speed: 12. 5mph Overall Average Speed: 9mph&#160; Day 1 – Thursday 65 Miles Clinton to Pilot Grove (Strava Ride): &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-2-800-f37254632. jpg” alt=”“Katy Trail Clinton Missouri Trailhead”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-2-400-f37254632. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-2-600-f37254632. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-2-800-f37254632. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-2-1000-f37254632. jpg 1000w”&gt; The trip started with everyone loading up bikes and gear in my Tahoe at 630 in the morning on 10/1. We drove from Wildwood, MO to Clinton and arrived around 1030am. From there we loaded the gear on to the bikes, and I rode over to the trailhead restroom to throw on my riding clothing. My father in law snapped our photo and we headed out on the trail around 11:10am.  The weather on Day 1 was great, though we had a headwind most of the day. It was somewhere between 60 and 70 most of the day and sunny except for when we were under the tree canopy provided throughout the trail. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-7-800-7c598794f. jpg” alt=”“Flat Tube on the Katy Trail”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-7-400-7c598794f. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-7-600-7c598794f. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-7-800-7c598794f. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-7-1000-7c598794f. jpg 1000w”&gt; We made it to the High Point on the trail, 955 feet above sea level, my Garmin showed 935 feet at that point. It didn’t take long before we were stopped on the side of the trail replacing a tube in Luigi's Trek. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-8-800-d98eb4500. jpg” alt=”“Flat Tube on the Katy Trail”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-8-400-d98eb4500. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-8-600-d98eb4500. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-8-800-d98eb4500. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-8-1000-d98eb4500. jpg 1000w”&gt; After Luigi's tube, the rest of the day was rather uneventful. Lots of slow climbing up the trail, I forgot how much elevation to expect on the western side of the Katy Trail, total for the day according to my Garmin was 1300 feet of ascent. With the Katy, you're never going up steep hills, but it is hard some times to tell if you're flat, downhill, or uphill. MOST of the time it looks like you're going uphill. Sedalia: We pulled into Sedalia sometime after 2pm and jumped off the trail east of the bridge that goes over Highway 65. You can cut through a field into a neighborhood that resides behind the various fast food restaurants on 65. We rode for a bit until we got to the area near Burger King so that I could fill my vegan desires with an Impossible Whopper. We couldn't go inside due to covid, so we rode our bikes through the drive thru and sat down on the curb of a closed business across from BK to eat our food. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-9-800-d34c4db4d. jpg” alt=”“Sedalia Burger King Drive Thru”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-9-400-d34c4db4d. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-9-600-d34c4db4d. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-9-800-d34c4db4d. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-9-1000-d34c4db4d. jpg 1000w”&gt; As we went through Sedalia we expected to come across some of the BAM riders, a group doing a 5 day ride from Defiance to Clinton. We never came across them, though we did see a sign for them directing them off the trail, so we figured they must of made it to their &quot;camp&quot; before we got into town. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-11-800-9f506ad3a. jpg” alt=”“Sedalia Missouri Trailhead Katy Trail”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-11-400-9f506ad3a. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-11-600-9f506ad3a. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-11-800-9f506ad3a. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-11-1000-9f506ad3a. jpg 1000w”&gt; There's a Katy Trail Detour in Sedalia, basically a section of trail that simply doesn't exist yet, so you have to head off on some city/country roads to get to the trail again. Going through on a Thursday afternoon, I don't think we came across a single car while on that section of the ride. Pilot Grove: We pulled in to Pilot Grove around 5:30 on Thursday night. We found a local who told us what our food options were in town Deon's Bar and the Casey's Gas Station. I called the local police number to tell them we were going to stay the night in the park, they asked for contact info, how many were in our party, and how many tents/hammocks and what color tent. There was no charge to stay in the park for the night. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-16-800-3b7aeb7a8. jpg” alt=”“Pilot Grove City Park Katy Trail”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-16-400-3b7aeb7a8. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-16-600-3b7aeb7a8. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-16-800-3b7aeb7a8. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-16-1000-3b7aeb7a8. jpg 1000w”&gt; We headed over to the park, setup the gear for sleeping, and got changed to grab a bite to eat. We headed back to the trailhead where Deon's was located and locked our bikes up outside to grab a bite to eat. I think I ate a small salad and tater tots for dinner that night, along with a Coke (mistake due to the caffeine). Deon's was nice enough, mid-Missouri bar, so, smoking occurring inside and Adam's Family on an old rear projection TV. It is also a package liquor store, so I looked to see if they had anything I wanted to try to haul on my bike for 3 days, fortunately I didn't find anything I needed. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-17-800-685bdae6e. jpg” alt=”“Inverted Niner RLT”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-17-400-685bdae6e. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-17-600-685bdae6e. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-17-800-685bdae6e. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-17-1000-685bdae6e. jpg 1000w”&gt; From there we stopped at Casey’s, I picked up 2 packs of brown sugar cinnamon Pop-Tarts and then we headed back to the camp. My bike had managed to flip itself over a wall while I was inside, fortunately no damage was incurred with that incident. Chilly Night: It was supposed to get rather cold that night, so we were concerned about how warm we would be in our hammocks. I had my rain tarp down low, trying to keep it close to where the hammock was to try and keep some warmth inside my space. I had a sleeping pad, sleeping bag, and an insert for the sleeping bag for extra warmth. I ended up not having the sleeping back zipped up all the way most of the night. I was uncomfortable all night, but not from the cold, I just simply couldn't get into a position that worked for me in the hammock and had a horrible night of sleep. I know that Luigi also had the same problem, because I could hear him moving around throughout the night as I lay awake. He unfortunately also had the discomfort of being cold as well. His sleeping pad didn't provide near the insulation that mine did, and his body isn't as well insulated as mine either. Wagner slept in his tent, and while chilly, I think he actually got a comfortable sleep. Day 2 – Friday 75. 41 Miles Pilot Grove to Tebbetts (Strava Ride): We set our alarms for 6am on Friday and got up well before the sunrise to start packing up all our gear and load the bikes back up. We left the park around 7:15am and headed over to Casey's to grab some breakfast and a coffee, only to find that it was &quot;closed for cleaning&quot;. . . Thanks covid. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-19-800-482da4bf3. jpg” alt=”“Flat Tire Pilot Grove”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-19-400-482da4bf3. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-19-600-482da4bf3. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-19-800-482da4bf3. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-19-1000-482da4bf3. jpg 1000w”&gt; We stopped at the trailhead to top off the air in our tires. Not 60 seconds in Wagner managed to BREAK the stem on his tubeless tire/wheel setup, somehow it didn't lose any air. The valve stem was clogged with sealant, even broken off with no valve in place, the air remained. We debated just riding with it like that, but I encouraged him just to go ahead and throw a tube in it. We were at a trailhead, had a pump, and a place to sit. Might as well change it there instead of running the risk of it losing all air 5 minutes outside of town. Breakfast: Especially because the Casey's was closed we were hungry for breakfast and decided to find something in Boonville. We arrived in town around 9am, maybe a little before, and found the Main Street Diner, a fine establishment with good food and great service. After a warm meal, heat, and a few conversations with a couple of other cyclists we decided to head back to the bike shop at the train station in Boonville. Google said the store was to have opened 9am, and since we were down two spare tubes (I still had my original 2) it was a good idea to grab one for both Luigi and Wagner. Unfortunately when we got back over to the bike shop they had a note on the door &quot;Due to covid, closed, open Saturday and Sunday&quot;. . . So that was that. No tube replacements would be purchased for the remainder of the trip. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-23-800-16d2610a4. jpg” alt=”“Boonville, MO Trailhead”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-23-400-16d2610a4. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-23-600-16d2610a4. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-23-800-16d2610a4. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-23-1000-16d2610a4. jpg 1000w”&gt; &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-24-800-72f4d8f2a. jpg” alt=”“Boonville, MO Trailhead”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-24-400-72f4d8f2a. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-24-600-72f4d8f2a. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-24-800-72f4d8f2a. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-24-1000-72f4d8f2a. jpg 1000w”&gt; &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-25-800-90d01ee16. jpg” alt=”“Boonville, MO”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-25-400-90d01ee16. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-25-600-90d01ee16. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-25-800-90d01ee16. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-25-1000-90d01ee16. jpg 1000w”&gt; Out of Boonville we made it through Old and New Franklin, and on to Rocheport. The Tunnel outside of Rocheport is always a cool site. Before getting to Rocheport though we had to deal with a little detour. It was actually pretty easy to reroute, and not have to go on the highway anywhere. You basically ride up to the closure, and take a right on the gravel road, hang a left, up and over the levy and you'll pass through a dry creek bed. We actually went to the left, climbed a grassy level and rode that east back to the trail/detour. It wasn't wet for us. Once you're through the creekbed you are basically back on the trail and on your way. Burr Oak: &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-30-800-24b19deaf. jpg” alt=”“Burr Oak Tree”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-30-400-24b19deaf. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-30-600-24b19deaf. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-30-800-24b19deaf. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-30-1000-24b19deaf. jpg 1000w”&gt;     Out of Rocheport we started looking for the Burr Oak tree. Another must see stop on the Katy trail. From the tree we continued on, planning to stop in Hartsburg, MO for lunch. The route was uneventful, we passed by the spur that connects the trail up to Columbia, MO. Shortly after that we came across three guys sitting on a bench on the side of the trail. I didn't pay too much attention to them, made the assumption that they were some college kids from Mizzou out for a ride, when passing by them one of them yelled out my name. I realized it was Justin, another buddy who told me he was riding the Katy Trail that week too. They were riding Wednesday - Sunday staying in hotels and B&amp;Bs along the way. I stopped to chat for a few minutes and then got on our way to Hartsburg. Upon entering Hartsburg we started scouting out some locations for lunch. It was after noon on Friday, so we assumed that we would find something open. A local at the trailhead said that everything was closed until the weekend, I looked online, and sure enough, online results told me the same thing. We decided to ride around town and check to see if the bar, or Dottie's were open, even though the online results said otherwise. The bar was closed until 3pm, but as we pulled up to Dottie's the open sign was flashing. In I ran, and sure enough, they were open! 1&lt;img src= /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-32-800-e975515fe. jpg  alt=  Boatillac Ranch   srcset= /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-32-400-e975515fe. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-32-600-e975515fe. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-32-800-e975515fe. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-32-1000-e975515fe. jpg 1000w &gt;Lunch: We sat down and had lunch at Dotties, followed by a trip to the restroom there and then back on the bikes for the afternoon. The plan as we left Hartsburg was to try to find a gas station where we could refuel, and make it to Tebbetts for the night. We made it down to the North Jefferson trailhead and didn't come across a gas station or grocery store. We pulled out the old Google and looked to see what our closest option was for a grocery store. It was going to easily be a 1 hour round trip to get something, so we started discussing if we had enough food for the night. Could we survive on snacks, and then do 25 miles in the morning to get to The Corner, in Rhineland, MO? Tebbetts: &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-36-800-873d91a3c. jpg” alt=”“Tebbetts Missouri”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-36-400-873d91a3c. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-36-600-873d91a3c. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-36-800-873d91a3c. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-36-1000-873d91a3c. jpg 1000w”&gt; We discussed it and decided we could. So we headed further east to Tebbetts to look for the hostel. Upon arrival in Tebbetts it was pretty easy to spot the Turner Katy Trail Shelter (the hostel) so we jumped off the trail at the trailhead and rode on over. There was a rider outside having a meal at a picnic table when we pulled up, we said hello and I went inside to check the place out. There was another rider inside, John (or was he Jim?). John was from Oregon, but apparently had been on the road for 7 years, over 60k miles bikepacking. He was headed back west, hoping to make it to New Mexico or SoCal and then perhaps take a break. Jim was from Springfield, IL, and had only a few days earlier started after his wife had given him the go ahead for a quick trip. He was heading to Sedalia to take a train back home. Wagner, Luigi and I all took the opportunity to get our bikes inside and unpack some things for the night. A local drove up and let us know that there was a fish fry in town, Jim was the first one to grab a &quot;plate&quot;. The three bearded amigos all cleaned up, took showers, and walked over to where the fish fry was occurring. There was quite a line, and for the first time in a few days, pretty much everyone was wearing masks. (Masks aren't a big thing in Mid-Missouri, but the group putting on the fish fry had them on. ) Fish Dinner: Only Wagner actually grabbed a box from the fish fry, myself being vegan, and Luigi eating extremely clean, there wasn't anything for us. So Wagner got a good meal, and we ate our planned bars/snacks for the night. We aren't really sure who was putting on the fish fry, but I assume it was a local church. They told us that this was the first one that they have had since Covid hit, and even though they ordered extra fish, they were quickly running out as they received far more orders than imagined. By 7pm both Jim and John were in their bunks, so the three of us got everything ready for our own bunks and I think by 730pm the lights were out. I ended up going to sleep with my air pods in, with the noise canceling enabled and Ohms from Deftones playing. I can't tell you the last time I went to sleep with music going (wifey won't let me), but I was out like the 13 year old me when I would listen to the radio every night going to sleep. I did end up waking up a little while later when the music stopped and turned it back on. About 11pm I remember waking up with sore ears, but the noise canceling was still working so I kept my buds in. Sometime early in the morning I took them out as the noise canceling had stopped. Our alarms went off at 6am and we packed up our gear and headed out the front door of the hostel. Day 3 – Saturday 108. 71 Miles Tebbetts to Machens to Black Walnut (Strava Ride): &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-37-800-7fcb4da6e. jpg” alt=”“Tebbetts Missouri Turner Katy Trail Shelter”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-37-400-7fcb4da6e. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-37-600-7fcb4da6e. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-37-800-7fcb4da6e. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-37-1000-7fcb4da6e. jpg 1000w”&gt; The morning started early in Tebbetts, taking off from the hostel around 7:10am. The plan was to ride to Rhineland and get some breakfast, there would not be many options between Tebbetts and Rhineland to grab anything else. As we stood outside the hostel making last minute adjustments before riding off, I mentioned to the amigos that I really wanted to try to get the remaining 105 miles completed that day, instead of breaking it up into 2 days. The last real option for camping was going to be Defiance, MO, that would put our total for the day around 70 miles. Wagner and Luigi agreed that we would try to finish, but if something came up, weather, mechanical, we would be open to finishing on Sunday. The route would take us through Portland, but there were no food options that we know of open early there, we had breakfast at The Corner in Rhineland a month ago, so we were pretty sure it would be worth the 25 mile ride to eat there. Before getting there though we needed to get through the rock fall on the trail just west of Portland. We were told by fellow riders that it was passable, though the website said there was no detour for the fall. We rode up to the rock fall and started to make our way up and over the rocks. Rock Fall Detour: &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-47-800-9a7a014c3. jpg” alt=”“Katy Trail Rockfall Closure”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-47-400-9a7a014c3. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-47-600-9a7a014c3. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-47-800-9a7a014c3. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-47-1000-9a7a014c3. jpg 1000w”&gt; This was no easy task, we actually climbed up one route and found that there was no way down, so we backtracked and went a different way. Definitely an exercise in patience and balance, and carrying heavy bikes. We made it down, towards the river, and came across a beaten down trail that took us the rest of the way. I'm pretty sure if we had just started looking prior to the rock fall we likely would have found a path there people had gone off the trail and made their own trail around the rocks, we took the hard way instead. The trail where closed was extremely overgrown, you can tell it isn’t getting traveled much, it is amazing how much nature can take back on her own. Breakfast in Rhineland: From the rock fall to Portland, and then on to Rhineland was uneventful. It was starting to sprinkle a bit as we arrived at The Corner, so we quickly got ourselves inside and found a table to sit down. I ordered oatmeal, hash browns and a bowl of fruit, and plenty of coffee, the same order I had back in early September. I will admit though, this meal wasn't as pleasing as it was a month earlier. The oatmeal was super watery, and not very warm. The bowl of fruit, instead of being mixed berries, was canned peaches, and the hash browns were far from toasty as well. The coffee though, the 5 or 6 cups, hit the spot. From Rhineland we headed east, the plan was to ride to Marthasville to get some lunch at the Gas Station south of the trail/ballfields. While we had breakfast it had rained quite a bit, and it would continue to spit and sputter the rest of the day, but it wasn't raining hard on us at any point while riding. We ended up having fairly dry trails, with little rooster tailing or mud throwing until we got much closer to St. Charles. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-51-800-4e33baa06. jpg” alt=”“Katy Trail Layers for Weather”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-51-400-4e33baa06. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-51-600-4e33baa06. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-51-800-4e33baa06. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-51-1000-4e33baa06. jpg 1000w”&gt; The weather kept the traffic down, we pulled into Marthasville and headed straight to the gas station to grab some snacks, the first time we picked up food from somewhere other than a restaurant besides my pop-tarts at Casey's on Thursday night. While at the gas station, we saw a group of classic cars, probably 20+ deep, pass down the road, including a Shelby GT 350H that pulled in to fill up at the station. We took our snacks and headed back to the trailhead to sit down and eat. As we were there a couple pulled up on bikes, they were daytripping from Hermann. They asked about restaurants, we told them there was one in Dutzow if they wanted to ride on a little further. By Dutzow we were ready to take a break every 8-10 miles, we were well over 175 miles for the trip by this point, so I wasn't concerned about taking a few extra breaks, though I was worried that if we took too long on the breaks it would stretch our day out past the available sun. We were in the end game now, the home stretch, on parts of the Katy Trail we regularly rode. Augusta: We stopped again in Augusta, grabbed some waters from Kickstand Katy and took the opportunity to have a few snacks and use the restroom at the trailhead. There was an event going on in Augusta, but there were very few bikes on the trail all day. The event, we believe, had something to do with the local brewery, but we weren't about to try to ride around and see what it was all about, it was time to continue east. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-52-800-44c65cd3d. jpg” alt=”“Greens Bottom Katy Trailhead”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-52-400-44c65cd3d. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-52-600-44c65cd3d. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-52-800-44c65cd3d. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-52-1000-44c65cd3d. jpg 1000w”&gt; We ended up riding through Defiance and stopped again at the Weldon Spring trailhead, as we passed through Defiance I was probably 10 miles as the crow flies from my house. The ride from Weldon Spring took us to the Green's Bottom trailhead for another break/snack, and from there we rode in to St. Charles for our last bathroom break of the trip. From St. Charles to Machens it was around 13 miles, so we placed a few phone calls to our wives, to let them know we would likely be ready for pick up around 630pm. The plan was to ride to Machens, and then ride 3 miles back to the Black Walnut trailhead for pickup, as there is not a way for cars to get out to the Machens trailhead. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-54-800-a328524cc. jpg” alt=”“Katy Trail St. Charles Trailhead”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-54-400-a328524cc. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-54-600-a328524cc. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-54-800-a328524cc. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-54-1000-a328524cc. jpg 1000w”&gt; &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-56-800-9379ed636. jpg” alt=”“Katy Trail Low Point”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-56-400-9379ed636. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-56-600-9379ed636. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-56-800-9379ed636. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-56-1000-9379ed636. jpg 1000w”&gt; St. Charles to Machens you ride past cricket fields and junk yards, followed by nothing but farmland. You will pass through the low point on the Katy Trail, 436 feet, though if you blink you might miss the sign, especially at dusk. We quickly rode through Black Walnut, not seeing any of our vehicles there yet. As we neared the end of the trail we came across the section of trail that had recently been repaired from a washout. As we went through this area, probably . 25 from the end of the trail, I hit a soft spot on the trail and about wiped out. I pictured myself losing the front wheel and face planting right there, 1/4 mile from the end, fortunately that didn't occur. Eastern Terminus Machens: &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-59-800-8ff140145. jpg” alt=”“Katy Trail Eastern Terminus Machens, MO”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-59-400-8ff140145. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-59-600-8ff140145. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-59-800-8ff140145. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-59-1000-8ff140145. jpg 1000w”&gt; Machens provides the terminus for the ride, we pulled in there at just about 106 miles for the day. Just after 6:20pm, over 11 hours after we left Tebbetts that morning. We didn't stick around Machens too long, we took a few pictures, rang the bell (maybe broke a bell too, see video later) and then jumped back on our bikes. We wanted to get back to Black Walnut before dark, and that was going to take some riding. We started off slow, but as we plugged along we started picking up the pace, from our earlier day pace of 12-13mph we were cranking along at 15-16mph and even up to 20 mph in a final sprint to the trailhead. When we arrived, everyone's wives and families were there, except mine. . . Natalie showed up a bit later, I said hello to everyone there and started unloading my bike and its gear at the trailhead. Taking the bags off so that I could get the bike back on the rack of the Tahoe without struggle. Just about the time I had everything ready, Natalie and my kids pulled up. Hugs and congrats were shared and then I packed up the Tahoe so we could get on the road and find some food. I planned on another BK Impossible Whopper as my reward for finishing. Review: Overall it was a great trip. Only two flats, no other mechanical issues on any of the bikes. My trusty Niner RLT performed flawlessly with its Maxxis tires (so glad I dumped those Panaracers). Will we do this ride again? Never say never, but I can't imagine I will do it again trying to camp. It would be much easier to just try to plan around B&amp;Bs or Hotels and the Hostel, rather than trying to carry all the gear needed for camping. That's not to say I won't try bike packing again in the future, I definitely will, but I'll be buying a tent and selling off my recently acquired hammock gear. If you're thinking about riding the Katy Trail, do it. It is such a great ride. While we didn't see much bike traffic on this trip, we totally expected more. The trail has been packed with new riders in 2020, I hope they continue to come out. We did benefit from weather that kept riders away on Saturday, but weather that wasn't so miserable that we suffered on the ride because of it. We didn't get to see much fall color, perhaps doing the ride 1 or 2 weeks later in October would help with that. &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-60-800-01bf86913. jpg” alt=”“Niner RLT Bikepacking”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-60-400-01bf86913. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-60-600-01bf86913. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-60-800-01bf86913. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/2020/KatyTrail2020/KatyTrail2020-60-1000-01bf86913. jpg 1000w”&gt; What's Next: Who knows what big adventure is next. I hope to continue riding the gravel bike this fall, and have already cleaned it up from the trip and removed all the racks used for the trip. Some time later this fall I am sure we will start planning some adventures for 2021. I am already in for the Dirty Kanza 2021 (or whatever the new name becomes) so I will plan to continue training for that. I have real concerns about being able to finish that 200 miles in the 21 hour time limit, so I need to really keep up on riding and training between now and early June 2021. I'm also really interested in crossing Missouri by boat. Perhaps that will be something to plan in 2021.  "

That hasn’t stopped the riding, though there has been less than planned, and no organized rides after The Mid South in March. Early in the summer we started the idea of riding the Katy Trail again. Once again planning for the end of September/early October as a few of us had done in 2017. This time we started planning that we would do it fully self supported, no one meeting us each evening carrying our gear, we would carry our own gear this trip. In order to make sure that was possible, we planned a shakedown ride over Labor Day weekend. We would start at the LeCave Memorial Trailhead in Wildwood/Chesterfield, ride ~4 miles to the Katy Trail, and then head west towards Portland, MO. Why Portland? I was looking for somewhere to camp, along with a place that had somewhere to get food. Portland has the River’s Edge RV Park &amp; Campground, as well as Holzhauser’s Bar &amp; Grill. The plan was 70 miles out, camp, and ride back the same 70 miles home the next morning. We wanted to test out our equipment, make sure that we carried the proper gear, and hopefully not to much of it. I also wanted to try sleeping in a hammock as I had never done that before. I always sleep on my stomach in some weird contorted position, knee raised to the side, figuring a hammock wouldn’t work for that I needed to make sure I could actually get some sleep. Luigi and I started at noon on Saturday 9/5. Wagner joined us for the start of the ride, but was not going all the way and staying the night in Portland. It would have been ideal to start at our usual 6am time, it was a hot afternoon on Saturday, but we really didn’t want to ride 6-7 hours and then sit around Portland all afternoon. We talked our wives and kids into meeting us in Portland for dinner on Saturday night, so they planned to bring some food and water just in case we didn’t find options at Holzhauser’s. The Katy Trail was busy, as it has been in 2020, everyone is out, and it is great to see so much traffic both on foot and bicycle. We made our way quickly through Defiance and on towards Augusta when I noticed what appeared to be an odd coloring in my front tire on my Niner RLT, I thought maybe it had a leak and the sealant was discolored with dirt. We stopped in Augusta, primarily so I could go “#2”, I’m a big believer in pooping when you ride, I’m a pretty regular guy, and if I don’t poop I get to be pretty miserable while riding, so any time I can, I will. After doing my business I took a look at the front tire and notice it was horribly misshapen.  I went over to the KickstandKaty snack bar to see if they had any replacement tires, as I had intended to carry a spare with me, but failed to pack it. Luck would have it, they did have a tire, but only a 700/32, which would have to do. She cautioned me that they were expensive, and then told me it was $30, to which I thought was cheap. She explained that she buys a couple from Big Shark just to have on hand, and only charges what she pays. Later when I got home I checked and the tire runs $12 online, but to be honest, that $30 saved the trip, more on that later. I was running 700/43 Panaracer Gravelkings, having actually JUST replaced the rear tire the night before because it had failed a few times on recent rides on the Katy and I didn’t want to have to worry about it leaking (with a tube). So I purchased the 32 width tire and coiled it up on the back of the bike, hoping that I could make it to Portland on the Panaracer and have my wife bring me another spare tire from home, and have the 32 JUST IN CASE.  Well, low and behold, we didn’t make it 4 miles out of Augusta before my tire started spraying sealant. I stopped, put the hole towards the top and let it seal back up. It seemed to hold, and have enough air remaining, so we continued on. Not 5 minutes later there was sealant spraying everywhere and the tire quickly lost the air it so needed to roll down the crushed limestone trail of the Katy. We stopped in the shade and performed surgery to swap out the tubeless Panaracer Gravel King with a Continental Ride Tour. The tire was noticeable narrower than the Gravelking, but you know what? It held air, which was more than those expensive Panaracers could say. I simply haven’t had good experiences with the Gravelkings. They might look cool, orange against my orange and white bike, but while riding the Katy trail in either late June or early July I had the rear tear (I won’t say it was a cut) in the middle of the tread, in two places, and I had to tube it and throw a barrier between the tube and tire. I don’t feel that the tire held up like the cost should. I got less than 1. 2k miles on those tires, with a majority of those being on the Katy trail, a crushed limestone rails to trails path.  From there, the rest of the day was mostly uneventful, except for water. We rode through Dutzow where Wagner departed and headed back to civilization. At this trailhead there was an aid station for a running group, I believe Run DRC, we would see these stations for the next hour or more as we went along the trail, it looked like they had runners doing either 50k and 50 mile runs. In Marthasville we stopped to take a break, I filled up the tire with the Katy Trail tools floor pump mounted at the station. Luigi rode down to the ballfields and picked up 2 bottles of water, one for each of us, and we headed on our way west. We made it to Treloar, and kept riding, thinking that water wouldn’t be any problem to find. Well, little did we realize at the time, Treloar to McKittrick is one of the longest, if not the longest, gap on the trail without stations. By the time we finally made it to McKittrick, just north of Hermann, MO we were running low on water, and I was most definitely running low on energy. The heat of the day was really taking it out of me. I was having trouble keeping my pace above 11mph, sometimes dipping below 10, most of the afternoon I had a heart rate of 160, which to me is higher than I would like for a long ride. In McKittrick I stopped, took my shoes off to let me feet breathe a bit and laid on the bench at the station. We asked another rider who was getting into his car where the closest water might be, he told us that there was a gas station a mile down the road, south of the trail. We decided that we could make it on to Rhineland where there should be water, instead of taking a mile detour. Once we were back on the trail, before passing through the tunnel at McKittrick we could actually see the gas station, it was nowhere near a mile off trail, so we took a left on the connector to the road to Hermann and stopped at the BP station to fill up. I grabbed 3 1L bottles of water and a Gatorade. Filling up our bottles and my pack with water, we had 1L bottle left and got back on the trail. We passed through Rhineland, and I saw the restaurant we would be eating breakfast at the next morning, The Corner. We got to Bluffton and stopped at a bench so I could take on some more fuel. I told Luigi we might see our wives driving by on their way to Portland to meet us with our kids. As we were sitting there, my wife’s blue Kia goes driving by with Luigi’s wife sitting in the front seat, wearing a bright yellow shirt, making her easy to pick out. We waved and then met them at the crossing where the trail crosses 94 just west of Bluffton to say hello.  We pulled into Portland just after 6:30pm, making it about 6. 5 hours on the trail, with stops and repairs along the way. The minivan was in the trailhead lot, but the families were nowhere to be found, they had made their way down to the river to entertain themselves while they waited for us. Luigi and I got to work setting up camp. I had previously setup my hammock, but I hadn’t setup the bug screen or the rain cover before, so that slowed me down a bit. We picked our spots, I learned that you shouldn’t pick a spot with a dirt pile right outside your hammock, as in the dark you’re going to kick it many times and get dirt on your feet and flip flops. Pretty sure I have any bites on the top of one of my feet from those dirt piles. Once camp was setup the family showed back up and we started figuring out what to do for dinner.  We went over to Holzhauser’s Bar &amp; Grill to see what options they had, pretty standard grill food, burgers, grilled cheese, fries, tater tots, maybe a chicken sandwich too? I ended up ordering tater tots and fries, I think I might have ordered two servings of tots and 1 serving of fries, neither of which got finished. The kids enjoyed their burgers. I ended up eating the two nut butter sandwiches I had made earlier in the day and had Natalie bring in case I couldn’t find any vegan options.  While we were waiting for our orders from Holzhauser’s we were outside and notice an off-road cart pull up to the campground, I figured that was Melody, the owner, so we ran down to get checked in with her and pay our $10 for the campsite for the night. She also made sure the bathroom door was unlocked and told us there is water via a spigot on the back of the bathroom. After dinner when the families left, Luigi and I took turns taking showers and making final prep for bed, locking up the bikes, putting any valuables that we wanted to secure into the hammocks with us. Around 930pm we hopped in our individual hammocks and tried to see if we could sleep. There was an RV or two parked in the campground, and music coming from one of them as the owners and guests hung out drinking around a campfire. I worried that they would be up all night playing music, but they ended up turning in before 10pm, and camp was quiet except for two other bike packers who came from Columbia, MO earlier in the day. They were sitting around a fire in their camp site talking till after 10 some time. I eventually fell asleep only to be woken at 1030 by another group of bike packers trying to get settled in for the night, having pulled in sometime after we got into the hammocks. They also came in from Columbia, having left Columbia at 9am. That’s a long day, 12 hours, ~65 miles. The hammock worked well for me, I was glad I had the bug screen, were were surrounded by trees, and bugs everywhere. At one point while getting ready for bed I saw a spider with a body the size of a chickpea walking right under my hammock, it was at this point that I thought about crushing it, and then thousands of little baby spiders running about, so I flicked it away from my camp and thanked myself for setting up the bug net. I slept on a sleeping pad and sleeping bag in the hammock. The pad helped actually keep the hammock “open” above me, (under the bug net), which I think made things more comfortable for me. It was a somewhat warm evening, I never got cool enough to need the sleeping bag that night. I imagine, hope, it will be cooler in early October, I prefer being chilly and warming up under covers when I sleep.  I slept okay that night, waking up occasionally, but not really struggling to go back to sleep. The alarm at 5:45am came far too early. We hopped out of our hammocks and started working to get camp broken back down. It was nearly an hour later before we got back on the trail, Luigi was waiting for me. One problem with overpacking, it takes longer to load back up in the mornings. We took off eastbound from Portland and headed towards Rhineland to get to The Corner for breakfast. It was Sunday morning, and they opened at 7:30am, we arrived there just 2 or 3 minutes after opening.  Breakfast was actually pretty good. I didn't know what to expect going in, but the place looks almost brand new. They had a breakfast buffet going, but nothing besides fruit on the buffet was vegan. I started by ordering hash browns and wheat toast, but before the waitress left, I asked if they had oatmeal and swapped out the hash browns for a bowl of oatmeal and a bowl of fruit. Once again Luigi was waiting on me to finish, kind of the story of the trip.  From there, it was pedal down to get back home before the heat of the day set in. We didn't quite make it before it got hot, but we got to at least Marthasville before I feel like I started slowing down again. Ultimately we made it back to Chesterfield just after 1pm, so our trip time was just under 6:15, including breaks and breakfast. Luigi ended up pulling me most of the way, both days actually. That guy is a machine, he just gets on his bike and rides. He never struggles, never looks to be working too hard, just chugs along. I tried my best to stay on his rear tire when I could, because it helped me to save on my energy and try to keep the pace better, but often times I would fall off and he would slow down until I caught back up. We felt as though we were into the wind both days, going west, it the wind was coming from the west, going east the wind was coming from the east. Our actual moving time on Saturday I think started out faster, but by the time we got half way I was drained and had a hard time. Sunday, we started out a little slower, but kept an overall better pace. My heart rate stayed below 140 for most of the ride, and if you follow Strava Suffer scores, the difference between two days was 582 on Saturday to 266 on Sunday. Sunday we had an average moving MPH of 13. 8, while it was 13. 3 on Saturday. My average heart rate on Saturday was 150bpm, Sunday was 135bpm. We did 1 additional mile on Saturday with the trek to the gas station. The moving time between the two days only differed by about 16 minutes, take out that extra mile on Saturday and we spent just about the same time on the trails moving.  Lessons learned from the trip: So it was a shake down ride, what did we learn from it? Hammock camping works. Hammond packs too much stuff. Luigi is a great guy to ride with as he will pull you the whole way. Carry less snacks/fuel. Buy more water. Panaracer Gravelking tires are shit. Don’t forget things (gopro memory card, spare tire)I carried way too many snacks and things for eating along the way. I don’t think that I consumed too much, but I definitely carried a lot. I need to be careful about what I pack and take on the bigger trip in October. We will plan better with water in October. I need to do some research on where we can source water along the way. All of the fountains on the Katy Trail are turned off, but I hear that spigots may be on, so I need to check a few out before October to see if that’s true. During our October ride, we will work to take on water any opportunity we can, to avoid being without. I tried to pack the essentials for my GoPro with three different trips to my basement office to get everything I needed, two trips specifically to get the memory card. Somehow I still managed to leave without the memory card. I turned the GoPro on as we set out from LeCave and was immediately beeped at telling me that I didn’t have a memory card in it. When we got to Portland I took the GoPro off to give to my wife to take home. It now had a cracked lens. So I rode with the camera on the front of the bike, but didn’t get to use it, and broke it. Other things learned: I haven’t ridden as much as I wanted to this year, I have some serious concerns about my fitness for doing the Katy Trail in 3 days in 2020. We did it in 2017, but we didn’t carry our camping gear, or food along the way. I’m thinking about actually changing the ride plan to do a half day on the 1st of October, starting in Clinton, instead of starting in Clinton on Friday morning. We’ll see how the rest of the gang takes to that idea. I was likely dehydrated after the ride. I came home, had a soda, and not near enough water before going to bed. Until mid day on Monday I had to watch myself standing up to fast, starting to get dizzy. After making sure to consume a lot of water today I think that went away. Overall the shakedown ride proved a success. I have already transferred the gear that was in my saddlebags to my NEW gravel bags from Ortlieb, transferring everything from the Topeak setup into these new bags which are just saddlebags, and not a third center bag. They should hold up better, and allow me some flexibility to strap something down in the middle of the rack if I wish as well. I have new Maxxis tires that I will get mounted to the Niner RLT this week, and I need to make some adjustments to the shifters as I ran out of the ability to shift the big ring on Sunday as we got into Chesterfield valley. I’ll be working on planning the route based on things learned during this ride, making adjustments for food, water and hammock space availability. If you’re on the Katy Trail October 1st through 4th, keep an eye out for my #MOGravel sticker, I will have some extras with me if anyone wants any. &nbsp; &nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;The film from the #katytrail #gravel #mogravel #gravelgrinder #ninerbikes A post shared by Chris Hammond (@thechristoc) on Sep 6, 2020 at 5:43pm PDT Photo Gallery: "

    "title": "Dirty Kanza 2020 has been postponed, what about your hotel?",
    "body": "2020/04/06 - So Dirty Kanza had their &ldquo;virtual gravel camp&rdquo; this weekend. Going into this, I figured it would be leading up to something. Some change, I assumed a cancellation for 2020 and reschedule for 2021, due to coronavirus. I was wrong (I am glad I was), this evening they announced that they were moving the ride to September 12th, 2020. There&rsquo;s a lot of information on the FAQ, my completely unofficial summary for those who are already registered for 2020: You can ride on 9/12, without changing anything about your reservation You can defer to 2021 (6/5/2021) without any fee, and not having to pay again next year) if you do so by 5/15/2020. You can get a refund for your 2020 entry fee, if you choose to do so by 5/15/2020, but you will need to enter the lotto again for 2021. If you aren&rsquo;t registered for 2020, but want to, at this point, I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s an option. Will it stay that way, who knows. I quickly looked through the FAQ (linked above) earlier and realized, crap, my hotel reservation is for the original weekend. I booked that hotel in the middle of June 2019, just weeks after DK 2019. I immediately logged into my hotel honors account and looked to try to change my reservation. No dice, the hotel is completely blocked from 9/9/2020 through 9/13/2020. I checked every hotel I could in Emporia, they are ALL Blocked that week. I was despondent. I decided to try to call the hotel, at 9:20pm on a Sunday night, in the middle of Coronavirus lockdowns. I got a remote reservation agent, she checked, she couldn&rsquo;t find me a spot either, the hotel is blocked off. She offered to call the front desk and see, so I took her up on that offer. After quite a hold, she came back and told me that the hotel is currently blocked off, BUT, they were taking names and going to be calling people back. It sounds like, and remember this is completely unofficial, and possibly wrong, they might actually be blocking that week for existing reservations from the original dates, to move them. I was told that they would call me back this week, and see about moving the reservations for me. I&rsquo;m extremely hopeful that this works out! My advice: Call your hotel, see if they are doing something similar, hopefully for you they are! I have a feeling that hotel space, as always, will be a premium, especially with the new date and school being in session at the college, where they normally open up dorm rooms for DK participants to use in late May/early June. Update 4/6/2020: I was able to get in touch with my hotel this morning and they moved my reservation. The rate is quite a bit higher, but at this point I wasn&#39;t going to argue. &nbsp; Update 4/8/2020: I reached out to the hotel again via their online chat, they talked to the manager, who then emailed me. I was inquiring about the rate that has doubled my overall cost for loding for DK 2020. &nbsp; Basically they said: They were already charging this rate before DK moved, there is another event in town that same weekend, and with the dorms unavailable, and a hotel having recently closed down completely, rooms are at a premium. . . So at this point I don&#39;t have any belief that I&#39;ll get my rate lowered down to less than $299 a night that we are currently being charged. That being said, I do have two rooms right now, long term I might not hold on to that second room, but I am keeping both depending on who all comes and rides, if more friends get in, or my wife decides to help crew, I need the extra space.

    "title": "The Mid South 2020 Ride Review",
    "body": "2020/03/30 - The Mid South 2020 was held in Stillwater, Oklahoma on March 14th, 2020. Team Bicycle Tips was represented by Chris^3 (Chris Cubed, Chris Hammond, Chris Lybarger and Chris Wagner). Chaotic times we are in, this chaos leads to delays in doing ride reviews, so here we are, 16 days after The Mid South, and here we go.  Where to start? I don’t even know where to start… Let’s start back in January. On January 8th, I, Hammond, got let go from my VP of Product Management role with a SaaS company here in St. Louis that built and managed software for the fitness industry. At this time, I was personally ready for the change in career, and was setup to be able to not need to find a job quickly. I took this opportunity to try to make some changes in my life, one of those changes was to start riding the trainer in prep for The Mid South, the other was to change my diet to a full vegan diet, with whole plant based non-processed foods. In the month of January was able to get some good training in, 278 miles either on the trainer, or outside on the bike. Starting in February though, my training dropped off, I only got 155 miles in, with the first training ride being the 10th of the month. On the 16th of the month, I rode the 2020 Prairie Roubaix 100k Rural Assault Ride in St. James, MO.  As the early weeks of March came to be, the world started to buzz about the coronavirus, and the week before The Mid South, news started talking about the risk of the virus. As the week progressed, things started to change quickly, emails from The Mid South said that they would not be cancelling, and the ride would continue, but offering up “deferrals” to riders who wanted to defer to ride in 2021 instead of 2020 (having to pay the entry cost again though). We left for Stillwater Oklahoma from St. Louis the morning of Friday the 13th, and on the way down listened to President Trump address the nation. We honestly thought they were going to shut the country down, and we would simply turn around and drive the 6 hours back. The President Speaks: None of that came to fruition, and we made it to Stillwater mid-afternoon. We checked in for the ride, walked around the expo. The Expo was fairly well spread out, but it was windy, so the vendors were having to battle gusts trying to take down their displays and pop up tents. The expo was no where near the size of the Dirty Kanza expo in 2019, but I don’t know how much of that is just the size of the event or due to changes with Coronavirus.  After perusing the expo we decided to take a drive out of town and check out what the surface we would be riding the following day looked like. It was shortly after 5pm. We drove about 6 miles of the route, and we were pleased, the roads were dry as a bone. We took a photo or two, and then went to check in to our hotel. We didn’t eat dinner, because we were short on time, and wanted to be at the rider’s meeting at 7pm, and figured it would be done by 730 and we’d head out to grab a bite. By the time we arrived back to the street outside of District Bicycles, just before 7, it was raining and very cold. We stood around in the rain, fortunately with umbrellas, but social distancing ourselves from other attendees. There was a band on the stage when we arrived, we figured they must be running long and the rider’s meeting would happen after they played. Long story short, it was 8:20pm or so before the guy (Bobby) who was going to conduct the meeting was up on stage. He was setting up with ANOTHER band. Did I mention it was raining now? Those dry roads at 6pm, were getting drenched, and it was COLD (low 30s), and we were getting very hangry. After the band started playing, with no rider’s meeting announcements having occurred, we took off, it was time to eat, warm up, dry off, and get some sleep. For dinner we headed over to Elm Ave, to check out The Garage Burgers &amp; Beer. I found an impossible burger that worked to fit my diet while the other Chris(es) found burgers to fit their needs. The Garage is right across the street from Eskimo Joes, which Wagner was enamored by, due to it’s “fame”. I’ll be honest, I’m not sure I had ever heard of Eskimo Joes, but he claimed it to be famous and pointed out that they were known for T-Shirts. We thought it was an ice cream bar, so we figured we might give it a try on Saturday night (more on that later). Up and At ‘em: Saturday morning we got up early to find that the Hampton Inn was FULL of Mid South riders, and the breakfast offerings were slim due to the demand of everyone up at 6am trying to get out the door. I had brought my own oatmeal along, so I fixed that while Wagner got in line to grab something from breakfast choices. The hotel went out of their way to try to make the best of things, so they were restocking as fast as they could. We then headed to downtown Stillwater to get ourselves ready for the ride. We found a good parking spot, right near where we had parked the previous day, and sat in the Tahoe for a few minutes. It was pouring rain, and there was plenty of standing water and even streams running down the streets. It had been raining all night, with signs of letting up LATE morning. Things were not looking good. The ride was supposed to start at 8am, but around 730am or so they announced that they were pushing the start back to 830. Took our time getting things ready, I ran off to the port-a-lou and tried to make my day a little more comfortable.  On the way back to the Tahoe I stepped in a big old puddle, completely soaking my shoe/foot. That prompted me to change socks before we even started riding. About 815 we made our way over to the starting area, it was packed. The night before we had seen maybe 100 people standing around for the rider’s meeting, that led me to believe that the ride would be small and attendance had been damped drastically by #Covid19. I was mistaken. There were probably two thousand people waiting to get started, and a few hundred townsfolk there to see us all off. There was no social distancing this morning, it was cold, it was pouring rain, and we were packed together. Heading Out: About 8:36am I think I crossed the line and headed out on to the course. The route started with (if I recall correctly) 2 miles of paved roads, and then quickly turned into MUCK. The very roads we drove the night before, that were pristine and perfect, were now a sloppy mess. And it only got worse from there. I really wish I could have seen what things looked like for the riders at the front of the group, but I am not anywhere near a rider of that caliber so we got to see the course after 1k other people rode through it first. We made it to Mile 12 (at right about 1 hour into our ride) and decided that it was a good place to stop to refill, and empty the bladder. With the conditions, it was discussed that there would be no refueling while riding, you simply had to maintain control of your bike at all times, there was no down time to try to grab something to eat, or to try to take a drink, even from a Camelbak. While stopped, a young lady pulled up and grabbed her phone, she immediately called the SAG line and asked for a ride back, she was done. I honestly can’t blame her, she said it was her first 100 mile bike race, and there was no way she was prepped for these conditions. I had wished she had gone further, but she was probably one of the smarter folks to actually started the ride. The SMARTEST people were likely the ones who didn’t even start at all. One thing I quickly figured out, nothing was going to stay clean on this ride, including my phone. So you’ll see only a few photos in the gallery above. I had intended to take more photos, but it simply didn’t happen, and the ones I did take were often smudged with mud. I can’t even begin to describe the mud. Oklahoma is known for red clay, and these roads, with 1k+ riders were TORE up. The mud was 5-6” deep at times. It got on everything. If you couldn’t keep pedaling, and had to walk, your bike quickly added weight. That weight came in the form of red clay, and frequently got so bad that it acted like brakes being applied, the mud would pule up in the fork and the tire would continue to throw mud into that fork causing everything to come to a halt.  We made it to around Mile 14 where the first closed road/bridge crossing was, the bridge was passable, but you had to get off your bike and haul it up and over concrete put in place to keep vehicles off both sides of the bridge. The further we went along, the worse the roads got. At a couple of points we came across 50 mile course diversions, and at one point we stopped to discuss whether we should abandon the 100 mile route and jump on the 50 mile route. We continued to truck on with the 100 mile route however.  Some Of The Conditions: As the roads got worse, people were walking through the grass on the side of the road, even that surface was soft and mushy, and hard to walk on. Early on people started having problems with their bikes, ripping off derailleurs, losing braking ability, and various other ailments. The surface overall was simply bad. So sloppy and muddy. If you could manage to try to ride in someone else’s track you might be able to keep your momentum up, but if you got off the line (and many places the lines were non-existent) you were screwed. I don’t know how many times I yelled “oh shit oh shit oh shit” as I was riding along about to completely lose it, the brand new (almost) Panaracer Gravel Kings barely able to keep the bike upright. Many times going down hills I would pass someone with their feet dragging, trying to slow themselves down because there brakes were gone. I thought, how is it possible that all these people are having braking problems. Well, later I would find out. I experienced brake problems of my own. Time For A Bath: At one point, I’m guessing around Mile 37, we came across a farm that had a hose out, people were taking the opportunity to wash their bikes off. I took the opportunity to rest and wait in line to wash my bike off. There were two farm dogs hanging out with all their new bicyclist friends, enjoying the pets that came as people waited for the hose. Not 5 minutes later my bike was completely covered again as if I hadn’t wasted 15 minutes waiting in line to wash it.  As we were going up a hill not too far after this farm, I saw a truck at the top of the hill, it was pointing towards us, and I secretly, almost audibly, hoped it was a shuttle bus and would offer us a ride home. It was not, it was some sort of milk/tanker truck, slowly making his way down a really nasty part of road, that on an average day was likely okay, but today was sketchy at best. (More on him later. ) After about 5 hours we had gone a total of 38 miles, averaging less than 8 miles an hour. We came to a paved road, one of the few that we’d seen up to this point, maybe the first since we touched dirt. We were heading west towards Perkins, OK. The road ran North/South, and would take us back towards Stillwater and other paved roads. If we decided we wanted out, it would be the path of least resistance for returning to the start. The three of us talked about it, and Lybarger decided he was going to keep going, so off he went. Wagner and I were discussing what to do, thinking we were going to try to keep going to Perkins. Next thing you know a red Chevy Colorado pulls up and asks us if we want a ride back to Stillwater. Yes, sold, take us home. We were done, and this opportunity provided us our out. We shouted to Lybarger who came back to us for a discussion. The truck could take 3 bikes, and 3 riders, but Lybarger decided he as going to keep going.  Abandoned: Wagner and I loaded up, and spent the next 30 minutes riding around with two guys from Colorado who were looking to fill the extra spot on the bike rack before taking us back up to Stillwater, which would be about a 30 minute drive. Come to find out that the gentleman who picked us up was Chuck Hodge, the Chief of Racing and Events for USA Cycling. He spoke about how pretty much every other USA Cycling event for the next 5-6 weeks was being cancelled, or had already been cancelled, and this was likely the last for quite some time. We came across a few riders who could use a ride, but none chose to do so. One guy had just recently gone head first over his handlebars and cut his chin. Chuck got of the truck, grabbed a first aid kit cut, cleaned him up, and offered him a ride. He chose to continue. Another gentleman that we had passed while riding, was walking his bike west. He had broken his bike, but he already had someone coming to pick him up, so he kept going towards the road ahead. Nope That’s Not It: We turned north (we had been heading east backtracking on the course), asking riders if they wanted help, and came across a lady stopped in the middle of the road to refuel. She was in the middle of nowhere, in fact, she was not even on the course, she had missed a turn. We informed her of this, and she questioned our sanity. She couldn’t believe she was in the wrong. We told her how to easily get back on course, she wasn’t far from the actual course. She was offered a ride, an out, but she chose to keep riding. We end up coming back towards the course and were going to drive back out the road we had come east on, towards the paved road where we were picked up, when we could see the Milk Truck off in the distance. It was climbing the hill, or attempting to, that it had been coming down when we passed it about an hour earlier, it was now stuck. It did not appear that it was going to make it up that hill, and there was no way that we believed we could get the Chevy Colorado around it due to the way it was lodged in the road. Chuck called this in on race radio to let organizers know, and we headed south to try to find another way around and back to the course.  At the location where Chuck had picked us up, we came across another rider, from Kansas, who had walked 2 miles back, to get to that point. He had ripped his derailleur off, and needed a ride back. Golden, we had our 3 bikes, 3 riders, and a ride back to Stillwater. Chuck end up dropping Wagner and the other rider off at our hotel. The idea being that Wagner could work on cleaning his bike (the hotel had a hose out front for this purpose) and I could head back to the Tahoe. I figured I was going to need to drive to Perkins in the Tahoe to get Lybarger. Chuck dropped me off near the finish line and I grabbed my bike, and backpack (but not my helmet) from the back of his truck, along with a selfie. I went over to the Tahoe to get my bike loaded up and a somewhat clean change of clothes put on. I was right about Lybarger, he had spent the 2 hours since we split from him, riding 12 miles into Perkins. They had closed up the aid station and most people were trying to find rides back to Stillwater. On my way down to Perkins I passed probably 30 riders who were all heading north towards Stillwater, riders who had chosen to abandon the ride and take paved roads back to civilization.  I dropped Lybarger off at his hotel and headed over to my hotel to try to get my bike, and myself cleaned up. That evening we headed back downtown and hung out around the finish line for a bit. We grabbed some additional swag (one thing about The Mid South, they had a ton of swag, and with the lowered attendance due to coronavirus, there was plenty of extra). Dinner With Joe: We then headed back to Elm Ave to visit Eskimo Joes for dinner. It ends up Eskimo Joes is bar and grill, a very large one, with a huge merchandise store, with hundreds of Eskimo Joe apparel items, and while they might sell some ice cream for desert, they are not an ice cream shop. They started out as a bar in the 70s, and added food after the drinking age was changed from 18 to 21. The food was okay, nothing fancy for my vegan palate. I had another impossible burger to continue to stick to my vegan diet, that was pretty much the only thing on the menu that would fit that requirement. I ended up picking up a couple of shirts, since EJ’s is apparently known for their T-Shirts.  Sunday morning we loaded up the Tahoe, grabbed some breakfast at the Hampton Inn and hit the road for the 6. 5 hour drive back to St. Louis. We stopped in Springfield MO for lunch, and picked up a few grocery items as we were hearing that more and more things were becoming scarce in St. Louis. We drove through Rolla and I pointed out a few of my old college haunts to Wagner. The Mid Summary: While initially we were disappointed that we abandoned the ride, we were not the only ones, there were hundreds, I imagine (wild ass guess) over 50%, probably close to 75%, of the entrants who entered, abandoned. The conditions were that brutal. That being said, while we were riding, besides the mental breaking down that the mud caused, we had a blast. Everyone was friendly and muddy together. Even with the lower attendance, and the much smaller festivities in town, and the very very very poor route conditions, no regrets were had for attending and attempting to ride the ride. The only thing I think we would have changed, we would have early on decided to do the 50 mile route, and attempted to complete that. 100 Miles simply wasn’t going to happen for us on the 14th of March 2020. Averaging less than 8 miles an hour for 5 hours was not going to get us to 100 miles.  The Aftermath: While we had fun, and we made our bikes dirty, we also did some damage. While nothing “broke” during the ride, that I knew of, my brake pads (new in January) were shot and needed replaced. I also had to replace my bottom bracket, my rear shift/brake lever and complete replacement of all cables. Ultimately I had about $500 in repairs/parts completed on my bike as a result of The Mid South, so it was an expensive 38 mile Saturday bike ride. . . Would we recommend it in 2021? If you can get in, absolutely. But if there is any rain, or it rains for 16 hours straight starting at 6pm on Friday night before the ride, go into it with gear that you don’t mind just completely trashing, or stay in your hotel and sleep instead.

    "body": "2020/02/20 - Note: This is not a paid advertisement, these bars were purchased by BicycleTips. com via our local bike shop at retail.  Last weekend we got out to the Prairie Roubaix 100k Rural Assault Ride down in St. James, MO. A few days before the ride I picked the Niner RLT up from Trailhead Bicycles after getting a mid winter tune up and new bars installed! Sometime last year I decided I was going to upgrade my bike in 2020, initially that meant replacing it, I was thinking about trying to fork over the cash for&nbsp; Niner RLT MCR, but after seeing that they are limited in the size of the frames that they have (I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo; 4&rdquo;) I decided that I would stick with the current bike and look at doing some upgrades to it. The first thing I decided was the Salsa Woodchipper Carbon bars, in 44mm. I had them wrapped in Fi&rsquo;zi:k bar tape, a mint/olive color which I thought was the best option (available in the shop) to go along with my orange/white RLT. I didn&rsquo;t want to do black on the bars this time around, and might change the tape up before Dirty Kanza. So a quick review on the bars, after doing 100k on Sunday: I found that going down into the drops was an experience, once I got used to it, I loved it, but it was definitely wide and felt odd at first. Reaching the brakes can be a little struggle at first, but once you get the feel for it I think it is much better. The overall ride was better, it was a cold ride, so I had my winter gloves on, but I didn&rsquo;t experience any numbness or reduced grip strength as I have in previous long rides. I&rsquo;ve still got a lot of training to do, and The Mid South coming up, so we&rsquo;ll see how my hands hold up as we get into some real distance in the coming months. If you&rsquo;re looking for a nice upgrade for your current ride, be sure to check out the Salsa Woodchipper.

We are going to quickly try to change that and get things moving again, we have 5 weeks until Stillwater (The Mid South, formerly known as the LandRun100). So training needs to kick into high gear. To do that, we’re going to venture down to St. James, Missouri next weekend for the Prairie Roubaix 100k. The ride starts/finishes at the Public House there in St. James, and has a 50k or 100k option.  While you are at The Public House, see if you can’t find any of their Best Ever beer, part of their St. Patrick’s specials for MST down the road in Rolla. "

    "body": "2020/01/16 - Two weeks in to the new year and we’re back with a post! Life got in the way of our plans of having more posts here early on in the year, but that’s okay, we’re getting life squared away and have been doing plenty of riding/training to make up for the lack of posts here. So let’s get things started with what is in the works for 2020: First things first, the planned rides. 2020 is going to be a busy year, we’ve already written about a few of the planned rides, but let’s document them here for now, always subject to change though as schedules align and diverge. First up, The Mid South (formerly Land Run 100), in Stillwater, OK in the middle of March (3/14/2020). If you didn’t enter, it filled up quickly and the wait list is quite long. I do believe that you can still get in using a transfer, meaning, finding someone who isn’t going to be using their entry and taking over that spot. MidSouthGravel. com Second, as of now, is the Tour Of Hermann Gravel Challenge in Hermann, MO the first weekend in May (5/2-5/3/2020). This is a 2 day ride, with ~100 miles each day, typically broken up into 3 loops (30-35 each loop) on day 1, and 2 loops (~50 miles each loop) on Day 2. This allows you to pick your distance by choosing which loops you do. You can still register for ToHGC Third is the big daddy, the Dirty Kanza. May 30th, in Emporia, KS. If you haven’t done this one, you’ve still got a few days to sign up for the lottery. At least one of the BicycleTips. com riders will be there, and we’re hoping we’ve got at least 4 guys there for the ride. Hammond is entered for the 200 mile route and in, Lybarger is in the lottery for 200 miles, while Wagner put himself in the lottery for 100 miles. Head on over to DirtyKanza. com for more registration details. Fourth, locked in, is the Big Sugar down in NWA (Northwest Arkansas), Bentonville, AR to be specific, though the route will go through parts of Missouri as well, October 24th. This is another event put on by the folks that run DK, and it is looking to be another one of the big names in Gravel in the Midwest. Registration is full, but you can find out more info about the ride at BigSugarGravel. com. Other notables rides (there are a lot more): : The Epic In Missouri, 150/80 is April 25th, 2020 and is near the Lake Of the Ozarks, MO. I’m still debating on this ride, though being a week before Hermann makes it a little more difficult to justify. Epic150. com Cuban Gravel Crisis will likely be held in October again, out of Cuba, MO. It doesn’t look to currently have a date, but I imagine it will be the second weekend of the month. Last year four of us did the 50, it was cold (below freezing at start) and was over 5k feet of climbing, definitely a ride worth checking out this fall. CubanGravelCrisis. com We’re continually updating our calendar of events, be sure to check it out and let us know if you’ve got an event you would like to see added! What rides are you looking forward to in 2020? Team Kits: We are tossing around the idea of creating a BicycleTips. com team kit for 2020. Jersey and Shorts (bib) that we can all be proud to wear. Just gotta figure out the logistics, such as, 1. how to control the costs, 2. can we order enough to place a custom order 3. how quickly can all that come together? If we had a cool kit, would you be interested in sporting one? "

    "body": "2020/01/01 - Not sure we&rsquo;ll get this posted before the end of 2019, but we&rsquo;ve at least started writing it before then! So a quick review of all things &lsquo;19, look for another post for what&rsquo;s coming in &lsquo;20! 2019 was our first real Gravel year, and hopefully the first of many. The year started with a plan, and that plan was to get registered for the Dirty Kanza, we really didn&rsquo;t have a backup plan. This occurred by registering for the Dirty Kanza lottery in January, two of us registered as a team from our local CrossFit gym, and another buddy signed up as an individual. I know a few other folks who registered as individual riders and they did not get in. Steve and myself got in with the team registration selection, and Chris L. got in with his individual lottery entry. More on DK itself later. So I got registered in January, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the beginning of April before I took my first real ride. I put in 270 miles in April, my second highest total for the year. We started May off with a big event, the Tour of Hermann gravel challenge. A two day ride, with the option for 1 to 5 loops. I ended up doing 2 of 3 loops on Saturday and 1 loop on Sunday, for a total of 108 hilly gravelly miles. If you haven&rsquo;t tried out some Missouri Gravel, get registered for the Tour of Hermann 2020, registration opened up recently, the event happens the first weekend of May 2020. I definitely don&rsquo;t feel like I was as trained for ToH as I needed to be, and hope to improve that for 2020. The end of May, and early June brought the grand daddy of them all, the Dirty Kanza. Upon completion of the ride I was sure I had to do it again in 2020, and started trying to figure out how I could guarantee myself an entry into the event. That brought me, and Chris W, back to Emporia in July for the Lunar Kanza. Some of the same roads as DK, with a sunset and some moonlit riding, along with plenty of opportunities to &ldquo;win&rdquo; prizes. I was able to secure myself a Golden Ticket, allowing me to bypass the lottery for DK 2020! August didn&rsquo;t bring any organized rides, but I was able to keep my streak of 200+ miles a month going. September brought riding in Lincoln Nebraska, on some of the very same roads that the Gravel Worlds took place on in August. If you haven&rsquo;t checked out some of the gravel in Nebraska, you definitely should. I put in 47 miles over a few hours, and didn&rsquo;t see a vehicle on the road for the first 2+ hours of my ride. The end of September brought a road ride with the 10th annual Pedal The Cause ride in St. Louis, of which myself and Dave took part for our 7th time, both earning the yellow jersey fundraising level this year thanks to very generous friends and family. It was another hot day, but a great ride around the roads here in St. Louis County. October brought the awesomely named Cuban Gravel Crisis based out of Cuba, Missouri. Another great ride on some HILLY Missouri roads. 50 miles, 5k feet of climbing, with a start time temperature of 32 degrees. After the Cuban ride, my riding tapered off. I got a couple of additional outdoor rides in with friends, and a trainer ride in or two, but definitely not enough riding! I crossed 1,802. 9 miles for the year, far off from my initial goal of 2,500, but almost 6x as many miles as I did in 2018. I just realized, with &lt; 7 minutes left in 2019, that this year was 1 mile less than my previous biggest year, 2012, where I rode 1803. 9. If I had noticed this 10 minutes earlier, I would have gone out and rode another 1. 5 miles to break the record, but this just means I need to ride more next year to make sure I surpass both 2012 and 2019. Hope you had a great 2019, and hope to see you out on some gravel roads in 2020! "

If so, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place to get some info to try to better your chances for getting in, or worsen them, nothing is guaranteed, so don&rsquo;t hold it against us if you don&rsquo;t make it! For all the official registration information, visit the DK Registration page, but for tips, read below. In 2019 there were around three thousand people entered into DK, over the various distances. We believe through the Lotto process, only 50% of the people who entered the lotto got selected, so they likely had six thousand entries. With the continued explosion of the gravel scene, they will see more than that 6k number this year, with little increase in the amount of riders that they can select (guessing it will stay near 3k). First let&rsquo;s go over some of the basics for Dirty Kanza registration (this is for DK 25/50/100/200 mile distances for 2020, not the XL distance as that selection window is closed): Registration is done via a lottery system, that system is open at 8am CST on January 6th through 11:59pm CST on January 19th, 2020. You must enter the lotto sometime between those dates, WHEN you enter during those dates doesn&rsquo;t actually matter. You must put your credit card information in at this time, but you will not get charged unless picked in the lottery. Registration costs: $35/$50/$130/$250 for the 25/50/100/200 mile distances. There are no refunds, and no transfers Selection will happen on or before January 27th, 2020. Registration will likely occur on RunSignUp. com, last year it used Athlinks, it appears most/all DK Promotions events (like BigSugarGravel) are moving to runsignup. com (watch for a rebrand/fork on that to bikesignup. com soon). In summary, you register for the lotto, then you wait, check your email on January 27th (or earlier) and see if you get a selection email (like below) or a rejection email. Improving your chances: So how do you improve your changes for getting in to the Dirty Kanza 2020? Here are a few ways: Group Lottery Option (better odds? worse odds? who knows?): So what is the group lottery process? Basics are that you sign up with UP TO 4 other people, all putting in the EXACT SAME name of a group, for example these two would be two unique groups,&nbsp; &ldquo;BicycleTips&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Bicycle Tips&rdquo;. When you register as a group, you&rsquo;re saying, &ldquo;I only want to register if these other people in my group ALSO get in&rdquo;, meaning it is all or nothing, basically taking yourself out of the individual lotto selection process. This is one way to go if you believe that you really want to ride but only if your buddies get in too. Last year, Chris and Steve got in due to the group selection process. Initially we were under the mistaken impression that the group process worked where, if ONE person in the group got selected in the individual lottery, everyone in the group got selected. What we believe occurs this year (and last year) is that our group was selected in a different process, outside of the individual selection. Camp Time (guaranteed way): One sure fire, but expensive way to get in to Dirty Kanza is to do one of their Camps. They have a camp in April, that goes from the 2nd through the 5th, and includes entry in to DK200 or DK100. The camp costs $2200, if you&rsquo;re looking to ensure that you get in to DK, and also get out and get some good quality training in, the camp option might be something to consider. Golden Ticket (lucky way): This is how Chris is getting into Dirty Kanza for 2020. Having attended Lunar Kanza back in July 2019, and he received (luckily) a golden ticket, which provides bypass to the lottery process. You likely will have a hard time finding a golden ticket for 2020, but definitely check out the Lunar Kanza in 2020 to see if you can&rsquo;t help get yourself squared away for 2021! "

    "body": "2019/12/09 - Earlier this year I had a Retul Bike fit done at Trailhead Bicycles in Ellisville, MO. One of the changes made during that fitment was to my saddle. At&nbsp;the time I upgaded to a Specialized Power Expert as my saddle for the Niner RLT I rode on gravel all year. This change was night and day, completely mindblowing how much of a difference it made to my comfort level while riding. So much that when I got off the gravel bike in August to prep for Pedal The Cause on my road bike I moved the saddle over to that bike as well. Over the past few months I&#39;ve been thinking about getting another saddle, so that I didn&#39;t have to switch one saddle between two bikes. &nbsp;I was thinking I would just get another Power Expert. Instead I talked myself into a little upgrade.  Say hello to my new Specialized Power Pro Elaston. I&#39;ve gone ahead and put it on the trainer for now, but plan to put it onto the gravel bike here soon and start using it as my full time gravel saddle. The saddle is made with a FACT carbon shell, and titanium rails, both helping to decrease weight. The Elaston foam is made up of beads, expanded into the foam. I&#39;m really excited about this saddle and how comfortable I hope it is to ride. &nbsp;I&#39;ll do another review once I have some mileage on the saddle itself, outside of the short stint I did on the trainer/zwift this morning.

    "body": "2019/12/04 - For the 2019 Dirty Kanza (halt pint) I had some concerns about how I was going to handle hydration for the event (be sure to read our 2019 Ride Review). I had a whole list of how items to take on the ride, some on me, some in the SAG wagon. Water, and water containing devices were some of the most critical items for the ride. For the 100 mile distance last year, there was one stop at ~mile 50, so I planned to ride that first 50 miles with enough water to get me to that stop. That consisted of two 24oz CamelBak Podium Chill bottles, both full of water. I also had a backpack that held 3 liters of water as well. The pack I had on my back was a Deuter with a 3L hydration bladder. The bag, and the water, were likely too much, too big, too much water, but it is what I had and I didn&rsquo;t want to spend money on another bag. For the first half of the ride, hydration really wasn&rsquo;t an issue, the second half however, it was more important. The sun and heat during the 2019 running of the Dirty Kanza were pretty intense. It was warm, and there were very few clouds to protect you from the searing rays. I don&rsquo;t remember exactly how much water I went through on the second half, but I do recall stopping at a farm and filling up a water bottle, chugging it, and repeating the fill before heading out on the gravel again. For the 200 mile route in 2020, I&rsquo;m going to have to figure out a good hydration strategy. Part of that strategy started this week with the ordering of a new hydration vest (or two). I picked up the CamelBak Chase Vest from Amazon on Friday with a Black Friday price of $75, and then another one on Cyber Monday for $65. So I now have a red and a black bag. The Chase Vest contains a 50 ounce bladder, so just under 1. 5 liters of water. My initial plans, months away from DK 200, is to have both bags with me for the ride. I will likely take the second bladder and freeze it ahead of time, and at one of the SAG zones replace an empty bladder with the frozen bladder to give me some cold water as the temperature starts to heat up for the day. As of 12/4/2019, you can still find the vest on Amazon, at least in black, for $75, the other colors are back up to the normal retail price of $99. "

Most of the rides we&rsquo;ve scheduled, daylight shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue, but I&rsquo;m planning on riding Dirty Kanza 200, so I will most assuredly be riding in the dark. With winter, and all the riding I need to be doing, I&rsquo;ll be riding in the dark long before the end of May. I&rsquo;ve been planning to get some lighting from Outbound Lighting, a group that launched their Focal Series back in November 2017, nearly doubling their $15k goal. They were (are?) based near St. Louis MO at one point, but I think have moved up to Chicago. They&rsquo;re still a fairly small shop, hand assembling each light, often times with a few week waiting period before their next batch is ready for shipment. I&rsquo;ve been asking fairly regularly at Trailhead Bicycles when they were going to start carrying them, but they didn&rsquo;t have an ETA the last time I asked. Last night I checked and their lights were selling at the usual price, $200 for the trail or road package, this morning when I woke up I found them available for $25 off. Order placed! Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have them here in the next two or three weeks, and hopefully I can get my sinuses cleared out by then. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure how I will deal with the length of time I will be riding after dark at DK, I imagine it will be 6-7 hours, so we&rsquo;ll have to see if I need to come up with a different battery situation for the lights. I&rsquo;m tempted to take some old LI batteries from my drone racing days and see if I can&rsquo;t come up with a nice high capacity all night lighting system. Check out OutboundLighting. com "

    "body": "2019/11/11 - As the registration opens up for Big Sugar Gravel in Bentonville Arkansas later this week (Friday at 8am CST) you might want to start thinking about accommodations. We learned last year that for hotels in Emporia Kansas around Dirty Kanza you have to book WELL in advance. Like, we booked in July of this year for the event next May, even though registration doesn&rsquo;t open until January. For the past few weeks the hotels around Bentonville haven&rsquo;t shown any availability around the Big Sugar Gravel ride, which is scheduled on 10/24/2020. Last night however we found that at least one hotel, the Hilton Garden Inn in Bentonville started showing as available that week. So we booked a room. If you&#39;re smart and book a rate that can be cancelled, you shouldn&#39;t have any problem cancelling your reservation if you don&#39;t make it into the ride registration. Not all hotels are showing availability that far into the future yet, what we can recommend from experience, is setting yourself a reminder to check hotels every day. When choosing your dates, try booking Thursday through Sunday, or Monday. If a hotel shows nothing available those dates, try to the &ldquo;try other dates&rdquo; option. That might give you some insight into how far into the future you can currently book. Location: Big Sugar is being organized in conjunction with Outerbike Bentonville. I don&rsquo;t know if the location for Outerbike 2020 has been specifically posted yet, but it looks like Outerbike 2019 in Bentonville was held around the &ldquo;buckyball&rdquo; field, which is near the Crystal Bridges museum. Assuming that Big Sugar start will be somewhere around there, it looks like the hotels near 102 and interstate 49 will be the best option for lodging options in 2020, as they look to be no more than a few miles away. You can always cancel if you don&rsquo;t make it through the registration process. If you missed out on a hotel, it they fill up soon, you can always look for cancellations. Last year for Dirty Kanza we lucked out about a week beforehand, getting a room at the Super 8, giving us the ability to cancel our reservations we had in Topeka Kansas, which saved us a good 2 hours of driving each day. &nbsp; "

On our recent ride at the Cuban Gravel Crisis, one of my compadres ran into a flat. Bombing down a hill, we came across a pothole, he was leading, and managed to hit the whole, relieving his front fire of the ability to retain air. He realized it was going down, so we stopped at the top of the next crest and he broke the bead to immediately start getting it ready for a tube. What we found though, was that the nut on his valve stem had been sealed onto the valve stem itself by who knows how many years of sealant from his tubeless setup. We spent 30 minutes on the top of that crest working to free it up from the valve stem, so that he could insert a tube into the wheel. It finally took Mike W. from Big Shark Bicycle Company to free it from the valve and allow us to get back on our way. Bicycle Tip #1: Check your valve stems, before a ride, to make sure that if you need to, you can get them removed from the wheel. Tip #2: You might also go ahead and buy some extra valve cores and replace those frequently as well, I haven&rsquo;t had one get gunked up with sealant yet, but I imagine that&rsquo;ll happen at some inconvenient point in time in the near future. Tip #3: Carry a leatherman, or similar multi-tool. Had we had one, or a pair of pliers, the stop would likely have been 5 minutes instead of 30. "

The team is branching out to the east, into northwestern Arkansas and southeastern Missouri to bring you the Big Sugar &ndash; NWA Gravel ride. It will be based out of the mountain biking mecca of Bentonville, Arkansas, and appears that it will consist of over 9k feet of climbing in it&rsquo;s first iteration, a 109 mile route, on 10/24/2020. We&rsquo;re a year away from the event, but it will be limited to 750 riders, and the registration opens up on November 1st, 2019, so less than one week away. On the heels of its inaugural year owning Dirty Kanza, the Life Time team is expanding its off-road portfolio to include a brand new gravel event - The Big Sugar. This event will feature crazy amounts of elevation gain, rugged and loose gravel and the beauty of fall in Northwest Arkansas. The new event will focus on celebrating the cycling community and is backed by the original Dirty Kanza team, with the addition of Bentonville locals Nat Ross and Gabbi Adams. In addition, we have established a collaboration with Outerbike Bentonville that will mutually escalate both events and make the weekend a complete cycling party! -BigSugarGravel. com Check out the new website up at www. bigsugargravel. com/ and be sure to keep an eye on things here at BicycleTips. com as we start planning for this ride!

    "title": "Cuban Gravel Crisis Ride Review",
    "body": "2019/10/23 -  October 2019 brought gravel weather to the Midwest, and the first big event of the season was the Cuban Gravel Crisis, in Cuba, Missouri on October 12th. This year the ride started in Hood Park, which is where the Crawford County fair is held. I realized once we got there that I had been there, almost 20 years ago, shooting photos at a concert for a local band from Cuba called N2Versatle. The CGC offered 3 ride lengths, 100/50/25, with the 100 starting at 7am and the 50/25 starting at 9am. I met the posse at CrossFit Wildwood and we headed down together in the Tahoe. This ride brought together the DK100 (Steve and Lybarger) crew and added in the mustached wonder of Wagner, we were team 3 Chrises and a Steve. Cuba was just over an hour away from the gym, so it was an easy drive down 44, a road so familiar from my many trips to/from Rolla for school years ago (I met n2Versatle as a DJ at the college radio station back in the day). We knew going into the ride that it was going to be a cold one, with start time forecasts showing 32-34 degrees. What we were not prepared for was how cold that would be! While waiting in line for the check in we quickly were brought up to speed on what Winter is like, because we had forgotten&hellip;. Missouri skipped Fall for a weekend, though&nbsp; now, two weeks later the weather was finally back into fall mode, today however it is going to get up towards 70. At check in we received our packages, which contained a bib number and timing chip. I mistakenly removed my timing chip, assuming that I needed to put it on my helmet, before realizing they had stabled the chip to the number so that we didn&rsquo;t need to mount it externally. We headed to the only warm place on site, the restroom, and prepped before getting the bikes ready. I&rsquo;ve really taken to utilizing the Chamois Butter this year. With that, in combination with my new Specialized Power Expert saddle from Trailhead earlier this year, my riding has never been more comfortable! Bike prep was pretty straight forward, get your bottles together, computer turned on, air in the tires. The real prep was clothing! I was wearing my Pearl Izumi thermal full length bib, wool socks, and a long sleeve Hincapie jersey. On my head I wore a PI head band to cover my ears, and threw on a Maxxis neck gaiter I got at Dirty Kanza this year. On my hands I wore a pair of warmer Craft gloves, and had those inserted into my bar mitts I had installed the night before on the Niner RLT. The Bar Mitts, holy cow, I can&rsquo;t recommend them enough. After about 15 miles I had to take my gloves off and go with a much thinner pair, because the combo of the Craft gloves and bar mitts were causing my hands to be downright hot. Caution on the bar mitts though. They can be cumbersome, and get in the way. They limit your grip options on a drop bar bike, leaving you unable to access the drops, but in cold weather, they are totally worth it. The ride started by heading out of hood park on an old gravel road following the train tracks that runs along side of Historic Route 66. The start felt a little unorganized, it was hard to hear the announcers due to the size of the crowd and distance from the PA, but once on the road things started to spread out. The road was marked with painted arrows, which worked out well for the most part, with only a couple of minor problems for people who either couldn&rsquo;t get their route isnto their bike computer (looking at you Wagner) or people who missed the arrows when marked poorly (also looking at you Wagner).  For the most part, the three Chrises rode in the near vicinity of each other all day, while Steve was a little further back riding his mountain bike with MTB tires mounted, instead of his gravel tires. We all stopped at the rest stop around mile 15 in Steeleville, and then again around mile 25 when Wagner hit a gravel pothole that helped to alleviate the air from the tire on his ride. He quickly popped the tube off of the rim of the bike, to discover that the sealant used on his tubeless setup had turned into Loctite for the nut holding his valve stem in. He was going to pop a tube in and keep riding. We should have simply tried filling it up with air, before popping the bead on the tire. We spent the next 28 minutes trying to figure out how to get the nut off the valve stem. We asked every rider who went by if they had a pair of pliers, no one did. No one had a Leatherman, we were stuck. Mike Weiss from Bike Shark Bicycle Company stopped with an old car racing friend of mine, Bryan. Mike and Bryan both attempted to get the nut off, to no avail as well. Until finally a rider stopped, he had acquired a new tool the prior week, and while it wasn&rsquo;t exactly pliers, it was close enough to pliers that Mike was able to get the nut free. Wagner threw a tube in the tire, pumped it back up and we were on our way again. Not long after the tire change, we county road E, which lead us down towards Cave Rd, which was going to be a quite the climb, followed by a jaunt through Onandaga Cave State Park, another location I visited 20 years ago (to the month) for the wedding of a pair of friends. These two climbs were tough, but they had to be done if we wanted to finish the ride, so we pushed through and rode on. Shortly after Onandaga, Wagner pulled away from myself and Lybarger as he is always much stronger on the hills than I am. Lybarger and I knew there was a rest stop coming up near Leasburg, but we weren&rsquo;t quite sure how far away it was. We ended up stopping about 1/4 mile beforehand to take a break and refuel, only to find the stop shortly there after and take another break. We almost missed the turn for the stop as the only marking I saw was on the left, on the inside of the left hand turn, thankfully my navigation was working. Unfortunately for Wagner, he missed this turn and end up with an extra 4 miles before the rest stop outside of Leasburg. After the rest stop, I was feeling extra lethargic and Lybarger headed off ahead of me. We both knew we were close, within the last 12 or 13 miles. Those are always the worst, the final slog, when the body wants you to stop, but you keep telling it that you are almost done and can rest later. Coming into the finish, much later than initially planned, both due to the 30 minute mechanical, and more so due to the 5k feet of climbing that the route had, was a welcome experience. The crowds of my last couple of bigger rides (DK and Pedal The Cause) were non-existent, but the finish was just as nice. &nbsp; I came through and immediately rode back to the Tahoe to get off the bike. Lybarger came over, with food in hand and pointed me towards a tent and food truck parked not too far away. I walked over to those to see what sustenance I could find. I found some pork sliders for $2 a pop, I got 2, and a soda from the food truck next door. Not the biggest meal, but enough to hold me over as I waited for Wagner and Steve to finish their rides. When they were finished we quickly loaded up and hit the road back to St. Louis. I had to get home to some family things, so we couldn&rsquo;t stick around, and didn&rsquo;t even have time to stop anywhere on the way home to grab some food. Overall this event was great. Beautiful route, HOLY HILLS there was a lot of elevation. Definitely a ride to look forward to again in 2020!  "

    "title": "2019 Lunar Kanza Ride Review",
    "body": "2019/10/07 - A few months late, but here it goes! Back in July, I headed out to Emporia again, this time with my buddy Wagner. We planned for a few weeks to hit up the Lunar Kanza, with the intention of 1) trying to secure a lotto bypass for Dirty Kanza 2020, and 2) having fun. In that order. Lunar Kanza is a casual ride that they organize close to a full moon, that happens in evening/early part of the night, this time it was in July, about 6 weeks after DK. There was a 50 mile option, the maximum length, that is what we planned to complete. Part of the draw for LK is that it is a little more fun, a little more casual, and there are opportunities to get &ldquo;tokens&rdquo; out on the course, that you can trade in for prizes after the ride. The tokens are spread throughout the course in unknown locations. The prizes for the tokens vary, from small, cheap things, to large expensive things such as a Lauf Fork, or a bypass on the Dirty Kanza Lottery for 2020. Wagner and I left St Louis at a decent time of morning on Saturday, planning for about a 4. 5 hour drive, with a 6pm start time, we weren&rsquo;t in a super rush to get there, and not in a super rush to get up and miss out on valuable sleep before we hit the road. We had booked a room at the Super 8 in Emporia, the same hotel that I stayed at for the DK in June. We got into Emporia around 3pm and walked around town a little bit. For Lunar Kanza there is far less setup, only a couple of vendors, and way less people crowding out this small town. So we got a chance to walk around a see a bit more than I did a few weeks earlier. We got checked in at registration for the ride at the Gravel City location, and then wandered a bit. After checking out a few sites we headed to the hotel to get our things settled there before the start of the event. This was mid-July in the Midwest, so Emporia was a little warm that day, our hope was that it would cool off as the sun went down. By the time we made it back to where the event was starting, it definitely had not cooled off, but a crowd had started to gather. We parked in the same parking lot I parked in in June, with nice easy access to where we needed to be for the start of the ride. We prepped the bikes, prepped ourselves, and got everything in order for 50 miles of Kansas gravel. The start of the Lunar Kanza goes north on Mechanics street and followed the same route as the 2019 DK, at least for the first few miles. We ended up crossing over the freeway and turning down the same gravel road we did in June. It was at this point that we saw our first token. We were so wrapped up in the ride that we didn&rsquo;t even realize what it was. Shortly after that was saw a couple on a tandem stopped, the lady was running back towards the token. This was ultimately the ONLY token we saw while riding the whole day. We were towards the back of the group, and we believe that this ultimately caused us to simply not see any tokens on the road, because other people found them and picked them up. We did see two other riders getting tokens while we were riding, but we considered those tokens already gone as we weren&rsquo;t able to have a chance at getting them. The LK route went north, then west through Americus and out towards the reservoir. We figured/assumed, that this would be a rest stop, as it was at the half way point for the ride, but in the weeks leading up to the ride information became sketchy as to whether or not there would be a rest stop there. We wouldn&rsquo;t know till we arrived, if there was or not. Originally Wagner and I stayed together, but at some point we got separated. If I recall correctly, I got ahead of him for a bit of time, he ended up catching me, and then passing me as I slowly ran out of juice on the day. I decided I was going to take my time, these long gravel rides tend to be a lonely type of suffering ride, so he rode on ahead and we met back up at the rest stop. Kansas gravel really is beautiful, and I got to see some amazing sites while out there riding. At some point before we got separated the first time, we saw a guy go down in some rutted roads. We managed to avoid the carnage and keep going. At one point on the ride there was a group of locals out partying in an above ground pool, they had some LK riders over and they were jumping in, full bike kits, for a cooling dip. I&rsquo;m sure the water felt great, but I wasn&rsquo;t about to stop and soak myself from head to toe. I did get a shot of the pool from my GoPro Fusion, it&rsquo;s posted on Facebook. At the rest stop I met up with Wagner again, and we refueled. The problem with the rest stop, it was at the bottom of Kahola Hill, so you had an opportunity to fill up on food, and then go out on the toughest climb of the ride. I paid for that, filling up on food was not a good idea. The hill hurt. Wagner got ahead of me and I was in for the lonely ride back to Americus. By this point the sun was starting to go down a bit, but it was far from dark. As the sun was going down I was able to get some fairly cool shots, if i do say so myself, with my phone. Some days I wish I rode with my DSLR, but most days I don&rsquo;t have any desire to carry that around. At one point you could see smoke on the horizon, and the closer you got the thicker/darker it got. Ended up being what looked to be a bunch of junk, maybe even an old trailer home, being burned. I&rsquo;m not sure if the timing of this burn was meant to coincide with the Lunar Kanza, but the smell/smoke definitely wasn&rsquo;t appreciated. Here are some of those photos: As the sun was going down I decided it was time to turn my lights on. By this point I was stopping to rest as I was feeling pretty tired. As I rolled into Americus I found Wagner at the rest stop waiting for me. I wanted to grab some water while there, and check the stop out. As I was doing so, I saw some of the volunteers filling up balloons, that had lights in them. I immediately thought that they were likely putting some tokens together, so I called Wagner over. I figured they were going to have multiple tokens, and we could each get one. We then realized that they were tying the balloons together, and that there likely was going to only be one token available. I then spent the next ten minutes trying to look inconspicuous. Eventually I saw one of the ladies head around behind the restroom there at the stop, she tied the balloons to one of the bike racks way in the back that no one was using. I immediately went over and untied the balloons. She asked if I knew what to do, I said yeah, take them with me. She said to make sure that they all made it back to Emporia. The token was 4 or 5 balloons, with ribbons, tied to a plastic ring, and a white tag with a number on it. I came prepared, I had zip ties in my backpack, so I went over to the bike and started attaching the balloons to my backpack. The zip ties I brought came in super handy, along with the backpack, it was going to be fairly easy to get the balloons back! Here&rsquo;s what my bike and backpack looked like as we headed out of Americus.  The ride the rest of the way was uneventful. It was definitely dark now, and the nightrider lights I had borrowed from Matt Struckman of 2TimingGuys. com, were excellent. I think I had a 1000 lumen light on the bike, and 750 on my head. Along with a nightrider tail light, and some colored lights off my kids bikes I was easy to spot on the road. Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget the balloons! We were on the lookout for the ruts in the road that had taken down the guy on the way north, but somehow we never came across them. I&rsquo;m still not sure how that is possible, we were heading back down the same road we went out on, but we never could find it. We rode into town, down mechanics street and into the finish area. The band was just finishing up, and starting to tear things down, so we headed to our car to ditch the bikes and some of our gear before we header over to trade my balloons/token in, and get some food. We ended up at the prize table and I was told I needed my number off my bike to claim my prize, but I was told that my prize was GOLDEN TICKET! What does golden ticket get you? Why, it gets you a bypass of the Lottery for the Dirty Kanza 2020! I was stoked to say the least. I wanted to quickly get back to get my number to make sure I didn&rsquo;t miss out on this! I rushed back to the car and back to the prize table to get my ticket. The lady tried to take my backpack from me, at which point I told her that wasn&rsquo;t the token, the backpack was mine, so she let me keep the balloons (minus the one she popped).  From there Wagner and I grabbed some food, and a drink. We sat down to eat and my balloons started popping on the ground. We didn&rsquo;t stick around too long, with the band having torn down, we ate and decided we would simply get back to the hotel and get some sleep so we could drive home at a decent hour the next day. The ride back to St. Louis was uneventful, except for stopping in Columbia, Missouri, where Wagner introduced me to Shakespeare&rsquo;s Pizza. It was excellent, and I even stopped there a week later with my kids when we went through Columbia to visit family on the other side of Missouri. If you haven&rsquo;t done the Dirty Kanza, or even if you have, be sure to check out Lunar Kanza assuming they do it again next year. I&rsquo;ll be out there if I can, July 20th, 2020! &nbsp; "

    "body": "2019/10/01 - It is (past) that time of year, Pedal The Cause 2019. Here in St. Louis Pedal The Cause is one of, if not the, biggest charity bike rides you can find. It takes place on the beautiful cycling roads of west county, starting in Chesterfield, spending most of its time in Wildwood, with a little loop down to Eureka as well depending on the length of the ride you do. You can even cross the Missouri River and ride in St. Charles County and Maryland Heights if you choose the Two Bridges route. The event offers a variety of distances, from spinning on site at the Chesterfield Amphitheater, a 10 Mile (PTC Circuit), 20 Mile (PTC Classic), 37 Mile (Two Bridges), 50 Mile (Big Hitter), 62 Mile (Metric Century) to the&nbsp; 98 Mile (Century). Ranging in Elevation from 321 feet to 4,809 feet for the century. Depending on the distance you sign up for, and when you sign up, you commit to raising a certain level of funds. Riding the Century route, and registering before July 1st, I committed to raising at least $600, had I signed up after July 1st, I would have needed to commit to $1,000. In previous years I had ran on the Team ASG-SPS team, but this year I changed things up. I wanted to try to put together a team for the gym we go to, so I started the CrossFit Wildwood team. We had 7 members total on the team, 2 other members from CrossFit Wildwood, 2 members from the ASG-SPS team, and my kids signed up for the team challenge. We set a team goal of raising $5,000, which I&rsquo;ll be honest, a few weeks ago, it seemed like we wouldn&rsquo;t get anywhere close to that goal. But as of right now, we have $4,695, and I believe we have another $2,000 coming in from a fund raising event we held with the St. Louis Region SCCA Solo program back on the 22nd of September. I haven&rsquo;t figured out what will happen with the team next year, if I can get a few more CrossFit Wildwood members to join the team and ride, we will&nbsp; keep it going, otherwise might just switch back to the ASG-SPS team with Dave and Beth. So how did Sunday go? Well, it was both WET and HOT. The morning started out with wet roads from a morning shower that came through before the start of the ride. It didn&rsquo;t rain too much, if at all, during the ride, but much of the roads were wet throughout the day. You had to breath through your nose while you were riding as to not collect/drink spray from the rider in front of you, and at each rest stop you needed to clean your glasses. The morning started out very humid in the mid 70s, and only went UP from there. It ultimately got HOT. So hot that they actually closed down a section of the course, the Babler Beast, the inner loop around Babler State Park. I started the ride with Aaron, riding with the Stifel team, but also a member at CrossFit Wildwood. We took off at a decent clip, but started towards the back of the group, so we couldn&rsquo;t totally gun it to try to stay with the fastest riders. Through Chesterfield Valley I feel like we could of used a larger pack for more speed, but we kept up a good clip and had a great conversation along the way. We skipped the first aid station at the Taubman outlets, and kept pedaling to get to the other side of the valley to stop at the aid station at the John L. LeCave Memorial Trailhead at the end of the Monarch Levy Trail. If I recall correctly, this was about mile 24 into the ride. Here I refilled a bottle with Gatorade, took a shot of pickle juice and had a half a PB&amp;J sandwich. From there we headed out towards Wildhorse Creek and then up Ossenfort. I told Aaron not to worry about waiting for me, as much riding as I&rsquo;ve done this year, I feel like my hill climbing hasn&rsquo;t been very good, so I figured he would be much faster up the hills and I wouldn&rsquo;t see him again. I am pleased to say I kept up with him for the first two hills, Ossenfort and Little Tavern. Once we got up to Hencken though, I was cooked and he was much faster. We met back up at the aid station in Greensfelder, and headed south on Allenton together. The loop south of 44 in Eureka is a pretty rough road, and steep climb to start, at this point I lost sight of Aaron and would only see him at two more rest stops going forward. Going up this first hill south of 44 I got really upset. I was climbing along, struggling, and I hear what I thought was a car behind me, I even started to yell &ldquo;car back&rdquo; to the riders ahead of me when I turned and saw an older gentleman cruising up and past me on his e-bike. This triggered me, here I was struggling, and here goes this guy just casually pedaling along, assisted, with ease. I really wasn&rsquo;t mad at him, but I was upset with jealousy. Later in the day, when he passed me 3 or 4 more times going up different hills, that&rsquo;s when I started to get upset. Good for him, he&rsquo;s out riding. But man, if you&rsquo;re going to pass a slow guy on climbs with your e-bike, stay in front of him so you don&rsquo;t have to insult him EVERY DAMN HILL there is. At the top of Allenton I stopped at the Greensfelder aid station again and went to the bike mechanic for some lube. My chain was loud as could be, and I hoped they could help me. I don&rsquo;t know why I put dry lube on the bike two nights before, at the Hermann Gravel challenge I learned that the dry lube comes right off in the wet conditions and makes a hell of a racket when it does. I was able to get some lube and the bad sounds went away for the rest of the day. From Greensfelder (the second time) you head back to Melrose, down and then up through Rockwoods Reservation back up to Old Manchester. Old Manchester goes west back out to Melrose and up to where Ossenfort and Melrose meet. At this point I stopped to rest in the shade a bit and chat with another gym Member, Beahm, who was volunteering at the aid station. I questioned his choice in Music, the guy must be late 20s, MAYBE early 30s, but he&rsquo;s rocking classic rock like it is going out of style. He must of been raised here in St. Louis listening to KSHE through his youth instead of 105. 7 The Point. From there you head down Ossenfort, which is always questionable when wet, by this point in the afternoon many of the shaded roads were still wet, even though the heat was climbing. My Garmin recorded a 99 degree temperature reading around there. From the base of Ossenfort it was down towards Highway T. This section of the ride, in the past, always sucks. You are completely exposed, no shade, going up an incline back towards Highway 100. For some reason, 2019 was different. I felt revived on this stretch of road and managed to pass two riders ahead of me and get across 100 and back on to Old Manchester in record time (for me). It was still sunny, and hot, but it didn&rsquo;t drain me along Highway T like I expected. Then it was a run east on Old Manchester to Pond, out to Babler State Park. I was definitely getting hot, and not pushing for any PRs along this section of the route. I was looking forward to Babler, because the aid station there typically has orange bandanas sitting in a cooler full of ice water, and on a hot day, these bandanas go a long way to making you feel cooler/better. I arrived at Babler, with the intention of grabbing an ice cold bandana, and then heading into the park for the &ldquo;Babler Beast&rdquo;, a counter clockwise loop of the park with a hell of a climb towards the end. Unfortunately when I asked for a bandana, I was told they didn&rsquo;t have any, and offered a cold paper towel. I said I would just grab one on the way back through, after doing the loop, but was quickly told that they had closed the part of the course in the park. Due to heat and injuries, they shut it down. I honestly was not too thrilled with this news. I have been training for Pedal The Cause all year, with the intention of finishing the full ride this year, something I&rsquo;ve only done once previously. I wasn&rsquo;t about to let this stop me, so I headed up the chute to where the close was closed, and I just went. They chased me, they yelled, they event sent a police helicopter, but I went anyways. I ended up completing the loop, in probably one of my slowest times ever, but I completed it. I was definitely hot at this point, so I made sure to take my time, and rested before going up the big climb. As I was going up the climb, I decided to stop and take two breaks, instead of stopping and walking, I let my heart rate come back down and relaxed. I also didn&rsquo;t want to overheat and need medical assistance, especially after I went against the ride&rsquo;s wishes, so I took my time, and I made my way around Babler State Park. When I stopped to rest at the Babler aid station again I noticed that two other riders came in behind me, also deciding to take to the closed section of the course. I ran into Steve at this point, who unfortunately told me he was experiencing cramping issues again. Wasn&rsquo;t much I could offer him, so I went ahead and&nbsp; left Babler and headed out for what I knew would be the worst part of the course. For me the last 20 miles of Pedal the cause every year is the worst. You have one hill, Reiger, which isn&rsquo;t too bad, then you head down Wildhorse, a steep descent and then follow along the creek for 3-4 miles. After that you head down to Centaur and back to the LeCave trailhead. This section of the road isn&rsquo;t too bad, but when you&rsquo;re doing it solo you just want to be done. I&rsquo;m typically riding this section of road with other riders, but for Pedal I always seem to be by myself, so it gets lonely to run by yourself. After the aid station at Centaur, you head down the Levy trail and then through Chesterfield Valley back up a climb on Baxter to the amphitheater. The first 3 miles on the Levy trail were great, the wind was at my back, and my riding was quick, After passing under the Boone bridge you go east, RIGHT INTO A DAMN HEADWIND (it was actually from the southeast, so&hellip; it go worse). I lost 6mph on my speed into this wind, and I was going to be heading east/southeast the rest of the ride. This is where I broke. I simply couldn&rsquo;t keep any speed up, my motivation was sapped. I wasn&rsquo;t about to give up on the ride, but my pedaling slowed, and I was passed by 3 individuals within the last 1/2 mile of the finish. 98. 24 miles according to my Garmin After the ride I had intentions of grabbing Sugarfire BBQ, but I was completely spent. I grabbed two bottles of Propel from the cheer/dance team handing out medals and water at the finish, found some shade and laid down for 20 minutes to recover. A big thank you to everyone who rode this year, volunteered this year, and anyone who donated to any pedal the cause rider or team. Aaron finished his first century, by riding some extra distance afterwards to get to the full 100 miles. Dave finished 73 miles, cutting out some of the course due to the conditions. Steve unfortunately had to get the SAG wagon back to the event start, seccumbing to the cramps. Now it is back to Gravel season. I&#39;ll be getting my Niner RLT setup this week and will be back on gravel roads to get ready for the Cuban Gravel Crisis coming up in less than two weeks. "

    "body": "2019/06/04 - &lt;img src=”/assets/images_out/Content/DirtyKanzaHeader-800-b777718f2. jpg” alt=”“Dirty Kanza 2019”” srcset=”/assets/images_out/Content/DirtyKanzaHeader-400-b777718f2. jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/Content/DirtyKanzaHeader-600-b777718f2. jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/Content/DirtyKanzaHeader-800-b777718f2. jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/Content/DirtyKanzaHeader-813-b777718f2. jpg 813w”&gt; Wow, what a weekend. The 2019 running of the Dirty Kanza has come and gone, and all I can think about is doing it again, not next year, but next weekend! I can&rsquo;t wait for the opportunity to enter and hopefully try the event in 2020. I&rsquo;ll give a rundown of the weekend&rsquo;s activities. The characters: The writer, Chris H. , owner of BicycleTips. com. The strong guy, Steve W. , fellow Crossfit Wildwood teammate for Dirty Kanza. The funny one, Chris L. former Autocrosser and full time funny guy. Dad, Bill H. , the SAG guy. We (Chris H, Steve and Bill) left St. Louis (Wildwood) around 7am on Friday morning, and headed west. The trip was decent, riding most of the way west on I-70 and then heading south around Kansas City on to I-35. It wasn&rsquo;t until we were within 15 miles of Emporia before we saw our first sign of other riders heading into town. We pulled into town and came across a Floyd&rsquo;s Of Leadville sprinter. &nbsp; From the gas station we headed towards Mechanic St to find the Expo, and parking. We lucked out in a lot that had a parking space just 30 feet from some of the booths setup for the expo. We hit a couple of booths and started looking for food as we had been on the road for 5 hours without stopping for a meal. We came across a small food truck area, with a couple of different options available. I went with the safe to choose pulled pork sandwich and hounded it down so that I could free my hands. We decided that before heading through the expo, which looked kickass, we would head over to the Rider Sign In area at the Lyon County History Center on Commercial St.  At the rider sign in we picked up our T-Shirts that we got for registering, and then had the opportunity to make a pass down the &quot;swag&quot; table, from which we were given Dirty Kanza socks, a head sock, a branded DK 2019 Camelbak bottl, and various other bits of gear and items from some of the sponsors of the event. While picking up gear I had the pleasure of meeting Jim Cummins&rsquo; wife Susie. After the swag table we picked up our parking sticker for our SAG vehicle, with two riders and one SAG vehicle we picked up on decal before heading back downstairs to find our SAG driver (my Father Bill). After finishing at the rider sign in area we headed down to wander around the Expo that had overtaken a few blocks of downtown Emporia. I can&rsquo;t even begin to describe all the cool things you missed out on if you didn&rsquo;t attend the Expo. There were bike manufacturers, tire manufacturers, seat manufacturers, parts and tools vendors, clothing organizations, training plans, electronic training folks, CBD vendors, supplements, nutrition planners, and many many more. I walked around and talked to more vendors than I have at any previous conference or expo I&rsquo;ve attended, and I&rsquo;ve attended quite a few with my day job in the fitness and tech industries. I picked up lots of swag for my kids, and items that I thought I could either use on the ride, or at some point in the future. One item that stuck out in the expo area was the Chaise lounge from Salsa Cycles, for more info on that visit www. chasethechaise. com and see another photo of it later in this post.  After partaking in the expo we got a message from Chris L. that he had arrived and was making his way over to the Expo. We decided that we should figure out when we could get a ride in, but before that we wanted to watch the start of the DKXL, the 350 mile race that started at 3pm on Friday.  After watching the start, we decided that we would head to the 4pm rider&rsquo;s meeting, and then after that meeting head out for a 10-12 mile bike ride to get our legs turning and check out the starting 5 miles of the course. The rider&rsquo;s meeting started off with a DK Productions video and then Jim Cummins stood on stage and gave everyone an overview of the pertinent event details. Basics, 200 mile ride started at 6am, 100 mile ride at 630am, with cutoff times equating to a 10mph average to/out of a check point. For the 100 mile ride we had to make it to the 54 mile check point by 12pm, and leave by 12:30pm, other than that the only time we had to worry about was the 3am time that the finish line would be shut down so they could open up the streets again. After the meeting we headed back out onto the street to get to our bikes to get ready for our ride. Before riding however I had to make a stop into Mulready&rsquo;s to see if I could fulfill one of my three goals for the Dirty Kanza, getting a selfie with pro-rider and 2017 DK 200 winner, Alison Tetrick. I was unsuccessful in finding her, but I did find her mustached likeness.  Dad took the Tahoe to the hotel to get checked in. We planned to ride about 5 miles into the course that we would be riding on Saturday and then turn back to town, and then on to the hotel. The ride out of town consisted of around 1. 5 miles of paved roadway before veering off state highway 99 and on to the infamous gravel.  This quick ride was amazing, at around 5 miles we crossed over a bridge spanning the turnpike and stopped to enjoy the view. We spotted a group of riders down the hill that had a vehicle following them, and a photographer. We figured out they must be some kind of a ruckus if they&rsquo;ve got photogs following them around on a Friday evening ride. They headed up the hill towards us, stopped and said hello, before we all headed back towards town. The group consisted of some of the Pro riders from the Education First team, with whom we enjoyed a casual ride back into town, before dropping them in our dust as we rolled onto the pavement. (In reality I believe they stopped to take more photos, but we didn&rsquo;t look back to check).  Heading back to the hotel was overall uneventful, though Steve managed to hit a bump and lost his tail light, we stopped to head back and grab it off the road, but before we could a pickup truck ran it over. Luckily I had brought a spare, so I gave him that to meet the requirement of having a front/rear light. The morning of the event we got up before 5am with the intention of leaving the hotel by 5 to get downtown. We managed to get a last minute room at the Super 8, so we were in town and not too far away. Originally we couldn&rsquo;t get a local hotel and booked in Topeka, that would have made for a REALLY early morning having to drive over an hour to get there. We got onsite early, found a good parking spot, the very same spot we parked in the day before, and started getting our bikes and our gear ready for the ride. We headed on over to the starting line around 530 to check out the DK200 riders lining up and to try to find a friend from Ohio who was going to be starting. Walking along the sidewalk I nearly bumped into him without even noticing until he said hello. We wished him good luck and wandered up to the front of the line to see what the lineup looked like. The had the &quot;12 hour&quot; line, and then in front of that they were introducing the pros and past winners.  For the Dirty Kanza 100 ride, we had a posted start time on 6:30am, after the 200rs rode out we headed off to grab out bikes and finish our prep. We lined up towards the back of the pack, not wanting to try to get out in the crush at the front. The reasoning behind this was twofold: one, we didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the chaos of the mass of people at the front, two, we didn&rsquo;t want to be at the front and worry about burning ourselves out in the first hour of the ride. When 630 rolled around and we started, it was a slow roll across the start line for us, it took us well over two minutes to get across the start line. The weather was perfect, sun was up, it was probably in the 60s with a slight haze, with gravel dust adding to that. The ride out of town was lined with people from the community watching and cheering riders on, it was very motivational to see so much community support. Very early on we started seeing water bottles littering the route, and people off on the side of the road for flat tires. We must of passed over 100 bottles on the ground on Saturday and I don&#39;t know how many flat tires. The first 25 miles or so of the ride were excellent, surface was great, the pace was good, not pushing too hard, but not going to slow either. As we were still heading north the road switched from maintained gravel to double track farm road that quickly got rutted. Fortunately the weather was beautiful for the few days before DK, otherwise this particular section of road would have been a mud fest. Around Mile 30 we changed our direction, heading west/southwest towards the town of Council Grove, the only SAG checkpoint, at mile 54, for the DK 100 route.  By the time we were heading west, Chris and Steve had both gone up ahead. I could have pushed to try to stay with them, but I wanted to take the day steady and not risk burning myself out. They stopped and waited for me a few times, but I had told them previously to feel free to ride on with out me. They both reached the half way check point ahead of me, I found Steve and my Dad cheering me on as I came off the trail into the parking lot at the high school. I had prepped PB&amp;J sandwiches for my meal at the checkpoint, so I grabbed one and an orange/vanilla coke, and a folding chair and plopped down in the shade for a rest. Before getting into my food I took off my shoes and socks to try to let my feet dry a bit. There was one water crossing (the whole day) and while I made an attempt at riding it, I only made it about half way before hopping off the bike and soaking both feet in the cool stream. It felt great, but gave me a nice sloshy shoe for the next few miles.  When I arrived at the check point I figured out I had missed something, my GoPro sitting on the front of the bike was dusty as hell, so I realized that the photos/video from the morning were going to have a haze to them, after that point I realized I needed to wipe the camera occasionally and did so for the rest of the day. Time flew by quick in the check point, I ended up spending an hour there, way more than I had planned, but I wanted to take my time and rest. Before departing I restocked my water supplies, food, and applied some sunscreen, recharged the GoPro Hero Session and removed my GoPro Hero 5 Black from my bag, leaving it in the Tahoe. For some reason I didn&rsquo;t use my spray on sun screen and went with a cream that I carried in my backpack. This particular brand happens to be extra thick, so I figured it would help keep me from getting burned. Shortly later out on the course however I noticed my arms were extremely red, so I began thinking that I was burning badly, and going to be in pain later that night. Fortunately for me, I think I just had a reaction to the sunscreen itself, while I was red all day, once I removed the sunscreen I was not burned, lucky me as it was sunny all day, no clouds, and hot. Before leaving the checkpoint Steve and I took the opportunity to use the restroom and reapply some Chamois Butter. While clipping in to my bike after this, I managed to fall over. I reached out for a guy standing near me, but was unable to get my balance and took a dive on my right knee. I scraped it up, but nothing too major. If anything this event gave me a shot of adrenaline, so we headed off. The route after the check point started off with a climb up a paved road, heading south out of Council Grove, before veering off to the west again onto gravel. To start off the second half of the ride Steve and I planned to stay together. He actually started having a leg cramp before the check point, and had been trying to work it out during our rest. Unable to do so, he was limited in his ability to push up the hills for the afternoon. He told me to ride on, but I decided that I would simply take the opportunity to slow my pace down and ride the hills and wait for him where necessary. This worked out well for me, it allowed me to ride and rest, without pushing myself overly hard and prevented burnout. After the check point we started to come across some DKXL (350 mile) riders who were heading north. I believe the first one we passed was Malinda Gillespie, pictured below. I&rsquo;m guessing this would have been around mile 220-230 for Malinda at this point, and possibly between 70-75 miles for us for the day.  The afternoon ride contains a few larger hills, more so than we found on the morning route, with quite a few rollers as well. It was also starting to get hot, very hot. I was concerned with dehydration, so I forced myself to drink. We came across a farm at one point that had a sign on the road that they had water, so I headed off to check that out and found they had a spigot ready for us to fill up. I was carrying two 24oz Camelbak bottles and a 3L bladder in my backpack. I quickly downed one of the 24oz bottles and refilled it from the farm water. I went through that bottle and refilled it again before leaving, Steve took off ahead of me, but I was able to get back to him in short order. Later in the day I felt I had actually consumed too much water at some point, and started feeling it. Fortunately I never got sick, and other than that slight discomfort I was fine. The longer the ride went on, the more the heat started to come into play. At the water stop I pulled out a bandana and put it on my head under my helmet. I believe I intended to douse it in water before putting it on my head, but I failed to do that, so the next time I stopped to wait for Steve I took the opportunity to take it off. I wasn&rsquo;t sweating so much that I was having to worry about sweat in my eyes, but I did put the bandana in a side pocket of my backpack that I could reach while riding and used it a few times to wipe my face off. At one point I came up to a hidden Y-Intersection and went right, not realizing that was the wrong direction. Fortunately my Garmin Edge 520 quickly notified me I was off course, to which I was SURE it was wrong. I pulled up the map view on the Garmin, and sure enough I was off course, so I turned around and went back to the proper course, and waited for Steve. His cell phone, which he had been using for Navigation, had overheated from being in the sun, and charging off a battery, so it was out of commission and I wanted to make sure he didn&rsquo;t miss the turn. We found out later from Chris L. that he and 2 other riders made the same incorrect turn and ended up adding about 6 miles overall to their ride going that wrong direction. They didn&rsquo;t end up back tracking, but found their way back to the course later on, missing some of the larger hills that we had to climb. On one of those climbs, while waiting for Steve to get up the hill I took the opportunity to perch my Niner RLT up against a fence for a quick photoshoot.  After the shoot, I looked down and saw a guy flying up the hill that many folks were walking, and thought, oh boy, here comes the Dirty Kanza 200 leader! I was right, and up came Colin Strickland. There were 5 or 6 of us at the top of the hill all cheering him on as he tore down the decline. It wasn&rsquo;t long after that another 200 mile rider flew by us going down the hill trying to catch up to Strickland. After that point we realized we now had to be a lot more cautious as to how much road we took up going up and down the hills, we didn&rsquo;t want to get into anyone&rsquo;s way, so we tried to pay attention to who was coming up from behind. At one point Steve yelled up to me, I thought telling me that a car was coming, I reached my hand out to make the motion that I was looking to hitch a ride. In doing so I about punched the two riders from the Education First team, I&rsquo;m hoping they didn&rsquo;t realize and thought I was simply giving them thumbs up as they flew by, and fly by they did. It was amazing how much faster these leaders were moving versus the average joes that were still out doing the 100 mile ride. As the DK200 guys got closer to us, traffic started to pick up, mostly due to various photographers in chase vehicles trying to get into position to catch the best shot they could. Here&rsquo;s a photo of one of the keeps passing me, photographer sticking out of the top.  We passed by a lake with some pontoon boats on it, they all cheered and yelled Let&#39;s Go Blues after they asked us where we were from. After the lake was a large hill, at least for Kansas. I rode up the beginning of the hill, walked the middle, and rode the top most portion. At the top was a lovely group of people passing out water and PB&amp;J sandwiches. I didn&#39;t take a sandwich but I gladly took their ice cold water. One of the other amazing things about Dirty Kanza was the people. The organizers, the volunteers, the town, the people along the route. There were thousands of people out there. Cheering people on, passing out water, waving, honking, clapping, ringing cow bells, it was great to see the way everyone gets involved in the event, and these weren&rsquo;t just people in Emporia, it was everywhere along the 100 mile route. One other stop on the ride was the previosly mentioned Chaise. Salsa Cycles takes the chair around to various gravel events and has people stop and take photos on the chair, in exchange for a copy of the photo (online) and a patch. Steve and I came across the Chaise at the bottom of a hill and had to stop for a photo. Due to his cramping he decided not to sit down, I figured I would take that opporunity to take up the whole couch and do my &quot;sexy&quot; pose, here you go. . .  I&rsquo;ve found that between mile 90-95 on a long ride, sometimes earlier, you really start to get depressed. You&rsquo;re not quite at the end, and your motivation is lacking. You start to really tire, get hot, and think you&rsquo;ll never finish the ride. It hurts to pedal on, you struggle to keep the motivation up. I experienced this on the DK100, our slow pace, the heat, made me simply want to stop. Stopping wasn&rsquo;t an option, I wasn&rsquo;t about to call my dad and have him come get us, but the urge was there. About this time Chris L. caught up to us. He told us all about his off course excursion. He and the two guys who had gotten lost with him were going at a little bit faster pace and headed up the road. At one point he asked me if I was signing up for next year, I told him to ask me tomorrow as my answer at that point in time was a resounding no. About 5 miles from the finish though we found a new gear, picked up the pace, and caught the three guys, bringing Chris along with us we took off towards the finish. The route back to the finish took us through Emporia State University with a climb or two added in there for good measure, just to make sure your legs hurt. Steve and I crossed the finish line together, I believe my official time was 11:07:00 and his profile shows 11:07:01, but we were pretty much side by side. At the finish we were greeted by volunteers who gave us a cold towel, our finishing badge and a handshake from Jim Cummins, DK Co-Founder. We received branded Half-Pint glasses, and some GU recovery drink before heading off for our finisher&rsquo;s photo. From there we found a place to sit down and sat for a good 30 minutes, fondly talking about our adventures that day. We compared our data, the distance travelled, the time it took, the elevation. My Strava route showed 4400&#39; of elevation, Steve&rsquo;s showed more, Chris&rsquo; showed 4900&#39;. My legs were the dirtiest part of my body, I expected my face to be covered as well, but I must of kept wiping my face with the bandana enough to keep it fairly clean. Over all I felt great, my body didn&rsquo;t hurt, I could tell the nerves in my left hand were an issue, something I had experienced after the Tour Of Hermann Gravel Challenge earlier in the year.  After attempting to recover for a while, we decided we should get up, change, and put our bikes away. We found a free bike wash and had the bikes sprayed off before putting them back on the rack on the Tahoe. I threw on a clean change of clothing, and wiped down with a wet rag to make myself look at least somewhat presentable before heading back over towards the finish line. When we got back over to the finish line I hit the Gravel City store to pick up some souvenirs for a friend and my wife. When we walked out, I saw Alison Tetrick in the finishing chute. She must of finished sometime while we were at the Tahoe. She was being directed over to the Finisher&rsquo;s photo area, so I ran over and quickly asked her if she wouldn&rsquo;t mind taking a selfie with me. I tried to line the camera up for the shot, but she grabbed my phone and told me her angles are better than mine, so she would shoot it. Before shooting it she got her first look at her finisher&rsquo;s face, and found a pretty awesome dirt unibrow, to which she exclaimed &quot;Ooh, I have a unibrow, I&rsquo;m so rocking this&rdquo;. &nbsp; She finished second at this year&rsquo;s event.  Saturday evening we hung around the finish area, and headed to the Mexican restaurant to grab some food. The atmosphere in the restaurant was amazing, competitors, fans, family, locals, all hanging out having a good time and good food. Afterwards we watched the last of the &quot;Race the Sun&quot; competitors, those 200 mile entrants trying to get in before sundown. One finisher beat the 8:45pm time by milliseconds to qualify. We didn&rsquo;t stay the whole night, the finish line was up and running until 3am, as competitors from the 100, 200 and 350 were finishing until early in the morning on Sunday. My recovery since DK has been great. We drove back to St. Louis on Sunday morning, leaving Emporia around 730am. I was worried that I would be sore sitting in the car for 5 hours, but we made the trip without problem and I&rsquo;ve yet to experience any real pain or discomfort since. The only problem I have is my left hand has some carpel tunnel like symptoms, numbness and lack of grip strength. I&rsquo;m hopeful that this goes away in a few days, it even provides me an odd feeling when typing, which in my profession is unfortunate, but hopefully only temporary. My Final Thoughts for the Dirty Kanza event. MUST DO IT AGAIN NEXT YEAR! I had so much fun at this event. I had three goals for the weekend.  Complete the Dirty Kanza 100 Spend quality time in the state of my birth Get a selfie with Alison TetrickI am proud to say I completed all three of those goals! We had a great time out in Emporia, Kansas for the 2019 Dirty Kanza. I personally look forward to doing this event every year I can get the opportunity to do so. We had great weather, great friends, and no mechanical issues! Between the three of us we didn&#39;t have a single flat. I don&#39;t know if we should attribute that to Luck, being Slow, or being Talented enough to avoid the sharp stuff. Maybe a little bit of all three of those. Later this week I&#39;ll have another article up covering any changes I made to gear selection, our previous post had links to all the gear we planned to bring, and I want to basically update you on what we took, needed, and didn&#39;t need.

Being that this is the first year that myself, Steve and Chris (3 St. Louis boys) are doing the ride, we are going into things a little blind, but one of the things that Steve and I talked about on our final long training ride this past Sunday, was a list of things to bring. Last night I started to put together a list of Google Sheets that I decided I would share it for anyone else who might be wondering what all they should bring to the Dirty Kanza! I&rsquo;ve added &ldquo;where&rdquo; I plan to have the item, in the SAG vehicle, on the bike, in my backpack, etc, along with a category. Not sure if the category is really necessary, but more info can&rsquo;t hurt right? (see over packing note) If you&rsquo;ve got any feedback, things you think we missed, things you think we&rsquo;re crazy for bringing, shoot us a message on Twitter @BicycleTips and let us know! Couple of items that I thought about and hope you&rsquo;ll find handy.  Water sprayer (garden type), should be good for cleaning the bike, be sure to fill it with water before you leave your hotel! Mud Stick, I read an article from Salsa Bikes the other day in which a rider suggested having a device to trying to get mud off your bike, a stick of some sort, perhaps a screw driver? Extra of ALMOST everything, you never now. Disclaimer: Being that this is our first DK100 ride, we&rsquo;re likely bringing things we don&rsquo;t need, and forgetting things we should bring, so we&rsquo;ll try to update this document AFTER the ride too, to help us remember for next year! I also am a habitual over-packer, so&hellip;.  "

    "body": "2019/05/15 -  One day I&rsquo;ll get better about these write-ups so that I make myself do them the day of the ride, or the day there after, when everything is fresh in my mind. That being said, the 2019 Tour Of Hermann Gravel Challenge was only 9 days ago, and it is still pretty fresh in my mind! Hermann Missouri is just a little over an hour drive from my house here in Wildwood, and I&rsquo;ve never been there before. The closest I&rsquo;ve been was the 2017 Katy Trail ride in which we passed north of Hermann on the trail, we definitely saw signs for Hermann, but that was towards the end of Day 2 (112 miles that day) and I was not at all interested in taking an off trail detour. The Tour Of Hermann Gravel Challenge was put on by the Alpine Shop, a store with a big local presence and great owners who support all sorts of outdoor activities. The event is a two day ride, typically with 3 &ldquo;Loops&rdquo; on Saturday, and 2 &ldquo;Loops&rdquo; on Sunday. This allows riders to be selective about the distance that they ride. I went into the weekend with the plan of riding 2 loops on Saturday (~66 miles) and 1 loop on Sunday (~50 miles). You can pick up your registration packet, T-Shirt, route maps, etc before the day of the ride, a buddy of mine from work went with me on Thursday before the ride and picked up our packets. The weather leading into the weekend was sketchy, with lots of rain heading into the weekend. Flooding in Hermann caused the event HQ to change locations from the City Park to a local elementary school, overall this ended up working out great, there were no issues that I could see from the location change. When the event started the weather ended up being nearly perfect. It was a tad chilly,&nbsp; but about 5 miles into the first loop everyone was stripping off their outer layers, including myself. Right before we left on the ride I tossed my wind cover into my backpack, and at the top of the first climb I stopped to take off my sleeves, really I stopped to rest, but the sleeves made for a good excuse. To get North out of Hermann you end up crossing over two rivers, and then head west on the Katy Trail. If you haven&rsquo;t ridden the Katy before, check it out, and check out our writeup from 2017. The first climb off the Katy was paved, but most of the rest of the first loop was beautiful gravel. I got to do my first (few?) water crossing, and got this great photo from Dan Singer of my reaction going across: The first loop was just over 30 miles, wrapping back into Hermann back to the elementary school. This provides a good opportunity to stock back up on supplies, food and drink, and prep for the next loop of the day. At this point I should mention that I was riding with a car racing buddy of mine. We&rsquo;ve both aged and started riding bikes, one of us still races cars, and the other rides his bike more. I&rsquo;m old and slow on a bike, but watch out when I&rsquo;m driving my car. Chris and I had ridden together most of the first loop, but at the break in between I told him not to worry about waiting for me, feel free to head out and ride at your own pace. We started the second loop, first having to try to figure out which direction to go (initial turn wasn&rsquo;t marked well) but once we got going we quickly figured out that we were in for a big climb. This time we were heading south of town, and climbing straight up on a paved road. I ended up being the slow man on the hill, taking my time climbing, and then getting harassed my some local kid in a white dodge pickup truck. He very kindly drove by, slowed next to me and yelled &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get killed&rdquo;. I less than respectfully yelled &ldquo;Thanks buddy&rdquo;. He stopped in the middle of the road and yelled &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you say&rdquo; and I responded &ldquo;THANKS&rdquo;. He then drove off. I have a little bit of a temper on the road, doesn&rsquo;t matter if I&rsquo;m on a bike or in a car unfortunately. I didn&rsquo;t get a good look at the truck, I wish I had, up the hill I saw a gray/white dodge parked in a lot, with a particular logo on the side of it. I knew the logo as a friend of mine works for the company, but the driver was nowhere to be found, so I couldn&rsquo;t be sure that it was the same truck that stopped to harass me, otherwise I was going to vindictively reach out and try to cause that guy some personal pain. I&rsquo;m sort of glad I didn&rsquo;t see enough details, I finished my ride, I didn&rsquo;t die, no need to try to get that guy fired&hellip; The first loop Saturday had around 2,000 feet of climbing, the second loop had more than that, and was far more struggle than I had planned on it being. Here&rsquo;s the elevation profile for Day 1&rsquo;s first two loops.  By the time I had finished loop number 2 on Saturday, I knew there was no way I was going to attempt loop 3, and at that point I was pretty sure I was done for the weekend and would not be returning on Sunday. It was about 230pm when we finished the ride, after sitting around for a while chatting I decided it was time to pack up and head home. I had initially thought I would stick around Hermann for the evening and enjoy the included dinner/prizes, but by this point in the day I was ready to just head home. I managed to make it home around 5pm and unloaded the bike from the car. I washed it off and then decided I was going to take it easy and watch the Kentucky Derby from the comfort of my bed. I managed to make it right up until they got the horses in the gates, and then I passed out. I woke up 15 minutes later and had to quickly rewind to see the results of the race, after all the chaos of the disqualification I wasn&rsquo;t ready to sleep anymore so I got up and headed down to the garage. I decided at that point in time that I was going to make it back to Hermann on Sunday morning to do Loop 4 as I had originally planned, so I spent a bit of time getting the bike ready again. With the water crossing in the wash I needed to get the chain lubed up and make sure everything was in working order. Sunday morning I got up early and headed in to Hermann, on the way there I distinctly remember thinking &ldquo;I should have my radar detector in, I would be very pissed if I got a speeding ticket in one of these little small Missouri towns, and then I would never want to come back to whatever town it was&rdquo;. Less than 5 minutes later I was pulling over in Washington MO getting a speeding ticket. My fault, thanks officer. I was going to be by myself all day Sunday, my buddy Chris wasn&rsquo;t able to make both days, and my buddy Chris from work had only planned on riding Saturday (which he bailed on due to family things). So I got setup early and ran into the Huebbe&rsquo;s, another pair of old racing buddies. I knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to be keeping up with them as I had checked out there Strava times from Saturday, so I just said hello and chatted a bit before heading to the start line for loop number 4. Loop 4 started with 17 miles of Katy Trail, which honestly takes a lot out of you. I was in a line, sharing some of the work load, flying down at 15-17mph, by the time we reached the turn off of the Katy trail I had it in my head that I was simply going to turn around and ride the 17 miles back into town and call it a day. The Katy Trail is draining, it is packed lime stone, and simply gives you no ability to coast, you pedal or you stop,&nbsp; it is fairly flat, no hills whatsoever, and becomes mind numbing when you ride it for a length of time, especially on Day 2 of a weekend. I sat down at the trailhead where we were to exit the Katy and resolved to finish the loop, no turning back now, I was going to ride whatever was ahead of me, I needed to, I need the training for Dirty Kanza. The rest of Day 2 was fairly uneventful, some climbing, some descending, lots of gravel. The original Loop 4 was supposed to be right around 50 miles, but at the start of the ride they informed us that there would be a detour due to flooding on Highway 94, so we ended up cutting out about 5 miles of route, and fortunately for me, one big climb in the process. After loop number 4 I was ready for a quick soda, and then packed up my things so I could head back home to try to spend some time with the family for at least a few hours of the weekend! With the Tour of Hermann Gravel challenge, you get a mason jar, and scoops of gravel for each of the loops that you complete. Because I had thought on Saturday afternoon that I was done, I grabbed my jar and my two scoops before heading home. I ended up leaving the jar at home, so I wasn&rsquo;t able to get my third scoop of gravel for Day 2, but I was happy with my results nonetheless. The #TOHGRAVEL told me that I had a lot more training to do before Dirty Kanza. I was told by a previous DK rider that the Tour of Hermann was tougher than Dirty Kanza, and while I didn&rsquo;t do the full TOH I sure hope that it was tougher than DK so that come June 1st I am more prepared than I think I am!

    "body": "2019/04/29 -  In prep for my riding of the Dirty Kanza 100 coming up in June, I&rsquo;ve been trying to get some miles in, and looking for some gravel that is &ldquo;near by&rdquo; to get some gravel miles in as well. Last week I was talking with my neighbor, who tends to ride his bike(s) a little, he mentioned the Femme Osage Trail, but I wasn&rsquo;t able to head out with him on Saturday afternoon. Sunday morning I decided I would try to map out that route based on what he said, and started looking on GravelMap. com. Digging through GravelMap I picked out a trail called the Hamburg Trail, that takes off from the Katy Trail in St. Charles County and goes out towards Busch Wildlife in Weldon Spring. Leaving the Katy Trail onto the Hamburg trail you climb about 300 feet and head towards &ldquo;The Mound&rdquo;, which is an interesting read in its own right. Once you pass the Nuclear Waste Adventure Trail, you&rsquo;ll go by Hell (Francis Howell High School), and then cross over Hwy D into the Busch Wildlife area. In Busch Wildlife there are 25 miles of gravel roads, many of those don&rsquo;t connect to anything, but you can ride in/out on them to get some distance in. I ended up doing two loops today in a segment that I&rsquo;m calling &ldquo;Busch Squiggle Outer Loop&rdquo; that is a 7:31 miles. There may be better gravel out there, but this little route is a great ride for me. It shows me how much effort it takes to ride 40 miles on gravel versus road, and how much training I need to get in before Dirty Kanza coming up! Next weekend I&rsquo;m riding the Tour Of Hermann Gravel Challenge, hoping to get 60 miles in on Saturday with 50 miles in on Sunday, but we&rsquo;ll see if my body holds up to that. I came home today and took a 3 hour nap, I need to look at some way to better fuel my body so I&rsquo;m not destroyed after longer rides. Busch Wildlife info from GORC &nbsp; "

Less than 2 months remains until I ride the 100 mile distance at the Dirty Kanza #DK100 in the hills of Kansas, so it is time to dust off the bike, dust off the keyboard, and get to stroking the pedals and the keys. So I&rsquo;m riding in the #DK, how did that happen? Well earlier this year a couple of us at the gym decided we were going to enter the lottery. When entering the lottery for the Dirty Kanza, you have the option of entering by yourself, or putting down a TEAM name (up to 4 riders I think). If you put down a team name, and someone from your team gets selected, everyone gets in. I don&rsquo;t believe that I was selected individually for the ride, but the other guy who ended up signing up, we&rsquo;ll call him Steve, was selected, and thus I was pulled in as well! I&rsquo;m not going to get into &ldquo;what&rdquo; the Dirty Kanza is, other than to say it is a gravel ride in the Flint Hills of Kansas, and is known as a tough event (race). We&rsquo;ll be riding the 100 mile distance, which is unsupported, and has one supply zone in the middle (50 miles) where you can have someone resupply you with food/drink/gear. In prep for the DK, I decided it was time to try to get my Niner RLT gravel bike sized a little more appropriately. When we did the Katy Trail ride in 2017, I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was as efficient as I should/could be on the bike, and I didn&rsquo;t want to relive some of that pain, so I booked a bike fitting at Trailhead Bicycles in Ellisville, MO. The fitting at Trailhead uses the Retul Bike Fit system. This was my first time getting fitted on a bike, so I wasn&rsquo;t 100% sure what to expect. Prior to the fitting I was told to bring: Shoes/Cleats/Pedals Kit (shorts/shirt) to ride in Bike Bottle of water SnackI booked the appointment for 4pm, and arrived shortly before that to try on a new pair of shoes that I had ordered (figured it was time to upgrade my 10 year old MTB shoes I&rsquo;ve been using). Once I tried the shoes on we began the process for the Retul Fit. Interview: The first step in the process was an interview, the bike fitter (technician?) Harrison asked me a series of questions. Height, Weight, DOB, any prior injuries, pain areas, average number/length of rides, etc. This is pretty simple, not sure how useful it is, though you might want to think of issues you have while riding before your fitting, I thought of a couple of things post interview that I spoke about, would probably have been more helpful if I had them written down ahead of time. Sit Bones and Foot Arch: After the interview the next thing I went through was checking my sit bones. If you&rsquo;re new to riding, your saddle (seat) is one of the most important things about your bike, being comfortable on long rides. It isn&rsquo;t about having the most padding, honestly most good saddles have minimal padding. To measure the sit bones I sat down on a tablet like device that measured the distance between my sit bones, the points that typically touch the seat on your ride. My measurement put me about 155mm, while the saddle on my bike measured around 143mm. I have often found that I sat crooked on a bike, I think we finally figured out why. With the measurement done we picked out a new saddle for me, the Specialized Power Expert in the 155mm width. In addition to the saddle fitting, before near the bike Harrison had me sit and put my feet on a touch sensitive pad that measured the arch on my feet. Sitting I had a fairly high arch. He then had me stand and measure how much my arch collapsed, to which we were both surprised that my arch didn&rsquo;t collapse at all while standing (I&rsquo;m a big guy, and have had some foot pain in the past, so I assumed it was an arch issue). This told us that I might benefit from some arch support to help keep my high arch while riding, but they didn&rsquo;t have any insoles in my size, so they had to order those. Cleats: From there I tried on my &ldquo;new&rdquo; shoes that I had ordered a few days before my fitting. I ordered the Specialized Expert XC Mountain Bike Shoes, in an understated color. The shoes fit great, so I was then measured to see where the cleats should be mounted. The position decided was fully to the rear of the adjustment range. I have never had my cleats this far back, but the fitting was being done for a purpose so I went with that decision. Flexibility: From there we went through some flexibility movements and measurements. I believe my mobility was pretty good for a guy my size (6&rsquo;4&rdquo; 250lbs), primarily due to my work in the gym for the past year. I won&rsquo;t get into all the specific measurements and movements, but angles were measured at my hips, knees and even flexibility in my feet/ankle. On the Bike: After going through the various steps, it was time to get outfitted for the bike. I was decked out in my kit already, but before getting on the bike I needed to be outfitted in velcro, for all of the sensors. Sensors were placed on the both sides of my body, on my shoe, ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, elbow and wrist. The sensors are part of the Retul fit system, which consists of a device that looks like a very large Microsoft Kinect, that records the data from the sensors and the various movements the body makes while riding. Once I was fitted with sensors I got on the bike and rode a bit to get warmed up, so that the system could record my initial data. My bike was mounted to a Kinetic trainer, all of which sat on a platform that could be rotated around 360 degrees, locking every 180, so that it was easy to transition between left and ride side recording. One thing to prepare yourself for while doing a fitting is riding, you&rsquo;ll get quite a bit of seat time. There is plenty of &ldquo;break&rdquo; in between, but you&rsquo;ll ride more than you might think ahead of time. Saddle: Once we got some basic riding in we started by working on my position on the bike by swapping my current saddle out with the new one from Specialized, in doing so the saddle was moved back a big, trying to bring my knee back towards the pedal more, instead of it being out in front of my foot/pedal at the measurement point. My saddle height was also adjusted to get the optimum power out of the position as well. We started off with my seat level, but ultimately brought the nose down a bit to see if that helps with some numbness I have had previously on long rides. Hoods, Stem and Bar Height: After working on the saddle and the rear of the bike we moved forward, to the hoods. Immediately we raised the hood angle up, bringing them more upright, without adjusting the actual bars themselves. While working on the front of the bike Harrison put the bars into an adjustable stem, which allowed us to move them forward and back easily for fitment purposes. The stem on my Niner RLT was 90mm, and he thought that might be too long based on the measurements we were taking, so we shifted to an 80mm adjustment and that brought me in line with the desired measurements. Trailhead didn&rsquo;t have an 80mm stem that would work on the racks, so they ended up taking one off another bike, not the idea setup, but it go us through the fitment. I may order a lighter stem here soon, but we&rsquo;ll see if I want to drop more cash. The last adjustment we ended up making was the bar height, we took one spacer out lowering the height just a bit. Finally: After all the adjustments were made, the shop owner gave the bike a once over, rewrapped my bars (due to the hood adjustments) and then they sent me on my way. I was instructed to take the bike out on 5 or 6 rides and then have a follow up fitment. I stopped by the shop today to schedule that follow up for next Tuesday. The fitment itself took just over three hours, it is pricey, and even more so when you start adding in equipment (shoes, saddle, stem), but I believe it is worth it for a serious rider (something I want to be). I&rsquo;ve been on the bike 6 times for about 120 miles, and overall I am very pleased with the fitment. I think the biggest improvement is the new saddle, it is so darn comfortable, though the longest ride I&rsquo;ve done is only 30 miles, I&rsquo;m hoping to get out for 40 or 50 miles this weekend before the follow-up. I don&rsquo;t find that I am super more efficient on my gravel bike now, it is still slower on the road that my road bike, but I am comfortable now, and that should help to minimize pain and discomfort at the Dirty Kanza 100 on June 1st, 2019.

    "body": "2018/01/01 - We&rsquo;ve been back in Missouri for just over 5 years now, and in that time I&rsquo;ve taken my mountain bike out to Howell Island Conservation area three times. Howell Island is located in the Chesterfield valley, off of N. Eatherton Rd, if you&rsquo;re coming from the outlet malls you will head south/west towards Centaur road. The area is pretty darn flat, though some of the trails are heavily rutted from vehicular traffic and flooding damage. I&rsquo;m assuming the vehicular traffic is farming or park related, but not sure on that. Howell Island is a really simple multi-use trailer, with 8 miles of trails. It is a very easy mountain bike ride, and not a highly trafficked route by any means, according to Strava only 9 people have ever completed the outer loop in the counter clockwise direction (which is always the route/direction I ride). The trail is a mix of fields and wooded areas. I&rsquo;ve got a variety of shots I&rsquo;ve taken at Howell Island over the years that you can see below to get an idea of a sample of the terrain.  &nbsp; Access to Howell Island Conservation Area: Access to Howell Island Conservation Area is available by caseway over the Centaur Chute. For foot and bike traffic access is limited to times when the Missouri River is below 16 feet on the Missouri River St. Charles gauge. Otherwise you can access it by boat, something I&rsquo;ve never done. To get there by foot/bike, you can park in the parking lot off of North Eatherton Rd in the Chesterfield valley. From there it is a simple ride up and over the Monarch Levy Trail. Once at the top of the levy trail you&rsquo;ll see the path leading down to the river and depending on the river levels you will see a concrete route that will take you across to the island. Here&rsquo;s what it can look like when the water is up. Apparently it is a popular kayaking spot, I&rsquo;ve seen people carrying what looked like a surf board back to the parking lot, and if you look up videos online you can find footage of kayaks going to town. New Years Day 2018: I rode on New Years Day 2018, some photos from that day are posted in the album above. The river level was around 8&rsquo;, and access was not a problem. It was a darn cold day however, with temps at 7am around &ndash;7, I decided I was going to get a ride in for New Years. Later in the day I found the motivation to get out and ride, so I threw some flat pedals on my Niner Air 9 and headed up to the parking area. It was a chilly day,&nbsp; with a riding temperature (Fahrenheit) average of 6, and a low of 3 degrees. I was much warmer than I expected to be, below you can find a breakdown of what I wore for the ride. Clothing: Base layer &ndash; Pearl Izumi thermal tights/bib, Hincapee long sleeve jersey. Mid layer &ndash; Under Armor long underwear pants and UA long sleeve shirtTop layer &ndash; North Face convertible pants, Oakley outer shell. Head &ndash; Wool Balaclava, Ski Helmet/GooglesHands &ndash; Neoprene gloves, Waterproof/leather outer layer glove over Neoprene Summary: Get out to Howell Island when you get the opportunity. If there is snow on the ground it can be a challenging route, depending on how much traffic it has had. 2 of the three times I&rsquo;ve been there have been with snow on the ground, typically in the wooded areas the snow is lighter, easier to travel, than some of the field portions of the trailer where the snow can be deeper causing for slower travel times. &nbsp; "

    "body": "2017/10/10 - Two of my three cycling goals were completed in the past few weeks. First, I rode Pedal The Cause 2017, the century again. I didn&rsquo;t walk any this year, though I did leave out the Babler Beast loop this year. I was fighting a cold, and it was very warm, I knew if I attempted it I would struggle to finish the ride, so I cut it short and completed 93. 4 miles with 4600&rsquo; of elevation gain on the route. A big thanks to everyone who helped me out this year with donations, I raised $650, bringing my lifetime PTC fundraising to $4,956. 69. My second goal was riding the entire Katy Trail. I&rsquo;m glad to say that the goal has been planned, attempted and completed the weekend of September 30th/October 1st 2017! Here are some of the stats for the ride, after that, the details. Katy Trail Stats: Direction: West to East Number of Days: 3 Dates: September 29, 30 and October 1, 2017. Total Distance Rode: 244. 1 Miles Total Time on Trail: 21 hours 47 minutes Total Moving Time: 17 hours 21 minutes Longest Day: 112. 4 Miles &ndash; Katy Roundhouse to Marthasville Shortest Day: 52. 5 Miles &ndash; Marthasville to Machens Max Speed: 24. 4 Miles Moving Average Speed: 14. 1 MPH Overall Average Speed: 11. 2 MPHPlanning and Logistics: We (Mike, Dan and Myself) started planning #KatyTrail2017 back in January. Initially we planned to do the ride in May, but we were unable to get a date that worked for those who were interested, so we planned the ride for the end of September. Originally we planned to have someone drop us off and we would bike pack the entire trip. The goal for the year was that we would train throughout the year, riding on the Katy, getting distance in, and hopefully take a practice ride over a two day period where we would ride somewhere for the night with all our gear, camp, and return back to our starting point the next morning. The training occurred, but the trial overnight trip never happened. A few days before the trip my father and mother arrived in Missouri, completing their drive/move from Arizona, with their RV. We talked my father into driving us to our starting point (more on that below), hauling our gear, and then meeting us each night at our designated stops! It worked out great! Route: Prior to the trip I came up with a plan for the route and timing that was adjusted over a few iterations. The final pre-trip plan is posted over here. The short version of the plan for the three day trip was: Katy Trail Day 1: Start Clinton, Missouri, lunch in Sedalia Missouri, stay the night at the Katy Roundhouse in New Franklin, Missouri. Katy Trail Day 2: Start from the Katy Roundhouse, lunch in Hartsburg, Missouri, stay the night in Marthasville, Missouri. Katy Trail Day 3: Start in Marthasville, Missouri, lunch in St. Charles, Missouri, reach eastern terminus in Machens, Missouri and return to St. Charles, Missouri for pickup. Changes: Overall we stuck to that plan, with two major (minor?) changes. We hit Hartsburg around 10am, way too early for lunch, we ended up having lunch in Mokane, Missouri. On Day 3 when we arrived in St. Charles, there was a Marathon going on, so we skipped having lunch there in favor of finishing in Machens and getting picked up near the end of the trail. Prep-work: Getting ready for the trip I made a list of things to bring (List of Items for Katy Trail Bicycle Ride). On Wednesday before the trip I made sure to get some grocery shopping done. Because we were going to have RV support, we decided that we wouldn&rsquo;t be buying breakfast or dinner each day, instead we would make those meals. This meant we only needed to plan to purchase lunch, and any snacks on the way that we didn&rsquo;t want to carry with us. We ultimately only purchased lunch 2 days, and didn&rsquo;t purchase any snacks along the ride, eating what we carried with us. In addition to food for meals, I purchased a box of Honey Stinger Vanilla Waffles, some Honey Stinger Gel, and Honey Stinger Fruit Chews, to haul along with me on the ride. I was going to be sleeping in a tent that my brother had loaned me, so I made sure to know how to set it up before we headed out. I highly recommend you do that yourself before a trip! I also ordered a &ldquo;self-inflating&rdquo; sleeping pad, and learned that self-inflating was a pipe dream, though manual inflation was pretty easy to do. The Trip: Wildwood to Clinton (Day 0, driving): &nbsp;: &nbsp;To get started for the trip, we headed out of Wildwood, Missouri around 4pm on Thursday the 28th. We decided to take off on Thursday, drive to Marshall Junction RV Park in order to cut the drive down a bit on Friday morning. This was planned to give us more time to ride and hopefully more sleep the night before the ride, instead of getting up at 3am and heading out. We arrived at the RV Park after dark on Thursday evening and setup camp. Mike was planning on sleeping in a Hammock for the trip, but the Marshall Junction site didn&rsquo;t have a great place to setup the hammock, he slept in the RV for the night. Dan and I ended up sleeping outside, myself in my tent, and Dan in a bivy sack. Friday morning we got up early, had oatmeal or pop-tarts for breakfast and loaded up in the RV and headed south through Sedalia, towards Clinton. Clinton to New Franklin (Day 1) [Video] [Strava]: We arrived in Clinton, got organized, and managed to get on the trail around 9:10am. We rode from Clinton to Sedalia at a pretty good clip. We had fresh legs (somewhat, considering I had done Pedal The Cause 5 days earlier), but we were a little shocked to find that the Katy Trail in the western half of the state is not near as flat as it is in the eastern half of the state. For the day, 78 miles, we ended up doing 1500&rsquo; of ascent, not a large number, but definitely a lot larger than we expected based on our riding of the Katy Trail out east. Before lunch we passed the high point (see photo) of The Katy Trail. We made it to Sedalia just before noon. We crossed the bridge over Highway 65, and headed off trail, north, through a field that dumped us onto a neighborhood street. We rode to the local Dairy Queen for lunch, filling up on food for the day. After lunch we hopped back on the trail and continued our way east through Sedalia. Just before the caboose in Sedalia, we came across a box, that had a sign that said &ldquo;Baby Rattlers&rdquo; with a picture of a rattlesnake on it. As we went by, Mike and I wondered if they could be real, I joked and said I bet lunch (Saturday) that they are baby rattles, and not rattlesnakes. So we headed back to check. Needless to say, Mike picked up the tab for lunch on Saturday. In Sedalia there is a section of the Katy Trail, from Griesson Road to Boonville Road that is closed. The detour on side streets is clearly marked (painted Katy Trail logos and arrows on the streets). It appears that this section of the trail has been out of commission since November 14, 2016, with no foreseeable end in sight, according to the Missouri State Parks site. Outside of Sedalia we started seeing what looked like CD-Rom sleeves attached to the mile markers, we probably saw them for 20 or 30 miles. At one point, Mike stopped to grab one, but after picking it off the mile marker, it didn&rsquo;t have any labels/branding, but did appear to have data on the disk. He reattached it back to the marker. Shortly after that, I believe in Pilot Grove, we found another one attached to a bulletin board, I went ahead and grabbed the disk. A week after the ride I finally put the disk into a computer, it ended up being a DVD-ROM disk, and had some religious propaganda on it, looks like it is a film called Heaven: Our Eternal Home by Questar. I won&rsquo;t dignify the film with a link, but if you&rsquo;re interested you can find it on Amazon. I&rsquo;ll be honest, I really had hoped it would be something cool, maybe a puzzle/game, a mix tape, or something else, but religious propaganda, snooze. Also at the Pilot Grove stop there were some painted rocks, labeled &ldquo;Sedalia Rocks!&rdquo;, I wish I had picked two of those up for my kids instead of that DVD. The rest of Day One was fairly uneventful, though if you&rsquo;re coming into Boonville from the west on the Katy Trail, be sure to watch the signage closely. I missed an arrow on the street and ended up at the old rail bridge, which is out of service, trying to cross the river. Ended up having to swing easterly around the casino and cross over the river using the bridge that vehicular traffic uses. We ended up at the Katy Roundhouse after crossing over the bridge and around a little bit of construction traffic, to get setup for the night. Camping at the Katy Roundhouse was easy, my father was already there in his RV, setup. After arriving I took a seat for about 20 minutes before getting up and starting to get the tent setup for the night. Showers and restrooms are available if you&rsquo;re camping (paying) at the Katy Roundhouse, there is also power outlets on the shower building if you need to recharge devices. For dinner we ended up cooking hotdogs and two boxes of mac and cheese. I think I was in my tent by 8pm, and asleep before 8:45 after turning my phone off. New Franklin to Marthasville (Day 2) [Video] [Strava]: We started off day 2 off with breakfast (eggs), and hit the trail at 7:15am, making great time to McBaine, Missouri. We made it to the Burr Oak Tree, which is one of the oldest trees in the State of Missouri. If you&rsquo;re able to, check this tree out. It isn&rsquo;t far off the Katy Trail, make a right (south) on Burr Oak Road. From McBaine we rode on to Hartsburg, which was originally our planned lunch stop. We arrived there just around 10am, and decided it was too early for lunch. We did get some great snacks though, the DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution) were hosting a Wheeled Warriors bicycle ride on the Katy Trail for the day, they supplied us with Gatorade, bananas, candy and granola bars for our efforts. From Hartsburg we headed further east, making our way over towards Jefferson City, there was another DAR station at the North Jefferson stop on the Katy Trail. We continued through the stop, but ended up stopping on the trail about a mile later. My legs were finally starting to feel extremely tired, so I grabbed a bench for a short break and snack. Mike and Dan stopped with me, I was feeling pretty frustrated at this point, and told them to head on without me, I felt like I was holding them back (I was). Fortunately for me they stuck with me and made sure I finished the day. Shortly after the bench stop, I realized that my rear tire was low, so we stopped and pumped the tire up. My hand pump didn&rsquo;t appear to work, so thankfully Dan had a hand pump that worked much better. We ended up fighting the leaking tire for the next couple of hours, hoping to find a floor pump at one of the stops along the way, but being unable to do so I ended up throwing a tube in the tire (it was setup for tubeless). Once were were able to get the tube in, the rear tire held air well the rest of the trip. Throughout the day we passed, and then were passed by, a couple of gentlemen from the St. Louis area. They had taken the train to Lee&rsquo;s Summit, and took the Rock Island Spur from Pleasant Hill to Windsor where it joins the Katy Trail. I believe they stayed in Hartsburg (maybe it was somewhere else) for their second night. We swapped trail positions with them off and on throughout Saturday, primarily due to my tired legs and leaky tire. We were keeping a faster pace as they were loaded down with all their gear, but due to my frequent stops they kept catching up with us. We had the opportunity to chat with them a bit, at one stop they asked if I was Chris Hammond, and if I know Dave Whitworth, it&rsquo;s funny where you run into former autocrossers. We ended up having lunch in Mokane Bar &amp; Grill there in Mokane, Missouri. I will tell you, there isn&rsquo;t much to Mokane. The Bar And Grill serves a cheap meal, with plenty of tater tots, and cold drinks! If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to stop, you can stop by there. We ended up not locking the bikes up, I left the chain in the RV on Day 2, no problems at the B&amp;G. We had hoped to fill my leaky tubeless tire in Mokane, but the stop there didn&rsquo;t have a bicycle pump, so we just used the hand pump and rode on hoping to get to the next stop with some tools. We continued on for the ride and passed through Portland, Bluffton, Rhineland, McKittrick and then Hermann. By this point my legs were really struggling, but Mike stayed right there in front of me and pulled me through the wind. Did I mention that we had a headwind for Days 2 and 3? Day 1 we had the wind at our backs, but not the other two days. Having Mike there sure helped, I know it wasn&rsquo;t fun for him to pull me the whole way, but it sure helped me finish. At the end of Day 2 we pulled into Marthasville. We weren&rsquo;t quite sure where to go, there were ball fields south of the trail, but I thought there might be a park up north of the trail that we were supposed to camp at. Luckily I saw that my dad was parked at the Marthasville Community Club park, which is the ball fields south of the trail, he had the RV plugged in (110v) and we settled down there for the night. Mike actually went on for another few miles, needing another 3 miles to reach his lifetime milestone for distance in one ride. I ended up meeting mine with 112 miles on Day 2. Next time, unless I&rsquo;m going for a KT record, I think we&rsquo;ll cut day 2 a little shorter. The park in Marthasville has hot showers, a restroom and access to a bar and grill, as well as a convenience store not far away. About an hour before we finished the ride I remembered I hadn&rsquo;t taken the hamburger meat out of the freezer in the RV that morning, so we weren&rsquo;t going to be eating hamburgers. We ended up having hotdogs and mac and cheese again for Saturday night dinner. In addition we also broke out the bag of Fritos. After my rough day on the bike, I decided I was going to spend my last night sleeping in the RV instead of my tent. I ended up freezing in the RV, should of taken my sleeping bag in there with me! I may have actually slept better the night before in the tent. Marthasville to Machens (Day 3) [Video] [Strava]: The third day started with Pop-Tarts for everyone (brown sugar cinnamon, warmed up in the toaster of course) and a beautiful sunrise in Marthasville. We weren&rsquo;t quite sure where we were going to finish our ride. Originally we planned to stop in St. Charles for lunch, ride to Machens at the end, and then return to St. Charles to get picked up. We had heard that the trail might be closed before Machens, and verified that via the Missouri State parks website. This left us with either 40, 52, or 64 miles depending on how far we went and how far back we came to get picked up. After riding for two days, we decided we were going to skip lunch and try to have my father pick us up somewhere near where highway 370 crosses the Katy Trail. After our healthy breakfast, we quickly hit the trail with the intention of trying to get to St. Charles in 3 hours, and finish our ride before noon so that we could head off to various kids sports games that were scheduled on Sunday afternoon. We made great time, reaching Defiance before taking our first break. From there we rode to the Page Extension where we were going to take a break. It turned into a short break because we saw a sign for the Big River Running company, and after inquiring, were told that there was a marathon taking place. The leaders from the marathon were coming down on the trail as we took our break, so we cut it short to try to get back out in front of them as to avoid traffic. Well, traffic was not avoided. We ended up running into the pack of runners coming the other direction on the Katy Trail out of St. Charles. The biggest congestion points were the feed/water stations for the runners, with volunteers there not paying attention to any trail traffic coming from the opposite direction. The marathon, and shorter distances, were finishing right in downtown St. Charles, on the Katy Trail, which created a huge mess. We ended up getting off our bikes and walking in the thick of it. Once we made it through the masses in St. Charles we hopped back on the bikes hoping to ride to Machens. True to the messaging posted on the state park website, between Mile Marker 35 and 34, the trail was in-fact marked as closed, but the orange fencing didn&rsquo;t cover the entire trail, so we decided to ride on until we reached a point that was impassable. On this section of trail, we reached the lowest point of the Katy Trail. You could tell that there had been flooding there, but I honestly don&rsquo;t know why the trail would be marked as closed in this section. It was very passable and safe, we saw multiple people along this section of the trail as well. From there it was a race to the end of the trail in Machens. Okay, we didn&rsquo;t race except for the last 1/4 mile or so, I was still too tired to push too hard until the very end. We reached the eastern terminus and celebrated. We actually sat there for a few minutes, soaking in all the glory of completing the 240 some odd miles of our adventure. From there we called my dad to see where he was parked, and organize how we were going to get picked up. We had absolutely zero motivation to ride back towards St. Charles, so I pulled out Google Maps to locate the nearest road we could ride to in hopes of finding somewhere that dad could get the RV pulled off and bikes loaded up. We managed to get up off of Highway 94, and Dad picked us up there for the ride back to my house in Wildwood. Here&rsquo;s a group shot from the finish.  &nbsp; &nbsp; Lessons Learned: If you are planning on riding the Katy Trail as your first multi-day bike trip, it is a great trail for that. Here are some of the things I learned on my first bike trip. Wear chamois cream, you might not want to, but trust me. I didn&rsquo;t the first half of the first day and paid the price with some chaffing the remaining two days. Fortunately I was only chaffed a bit, and not too sore on the seat the whole way. I definitely do not recommend trying to do it completely self supported in 3 days. If we had been carrying all of our gear, there is no way we would have made the time that we were able to make. My legs definitely would have stopped working if I had the bike loaded down with another 10-20lbs of gear (guessing at weight here). If you&rsquo;ve got someone supporting you, carrying most of your gear, the ride is definitely doable in 3 days. We probably could have saved 20 or 30 miles from Day 2, and completed the distance on Day 3 instead, saving some of the extra effort of doing 112 miles that day. If I were to change anything, I simply would have taken my Camelbak and some food, I didn&rsquo;t need a rear bag, or frame bag for this trip supported. Another thing I wish we had done was taken more time to enjoy the views, the stops, the friends. We were pushing it pretty hard for 3 days, and while it was a great ride and great effort, we didn&rsquo;t get near as much time as I think we all would have liked to stop and smell the roses a bit more. If you&rsquo;re considering riding the Katy Trail, definitely get out and ride the Katy a lot before hand. Get to know the surface. It is an interesting surface, a crushed limestone I believe. The trail is pretty darn flat (at least most of it) so you will not have many hills to climb, or descents to bomb. You will be pedaling, a LOT. The trail slows you down if you stop pedaling, so get those legs used to turning over and over and over again, for hours at a time! Be sure to plan out your stops for where water and services will be available. After riding the Katy many hundreds of miles on the eastern side, we expected every stop to be like Augusta or Marthasville, and they most definitely are not. Some stops have bathrooms, some have water, some have both. Some stops even have bike tools, but it&rsquo;s pretty much guaranteed the stop where you need the bike tools won&rsquo;t have them. What comes next?: What comes next for riding? Well, I&rsquo;ve taken a week off, and due to travel this week, will not likely be on a bike again until this coming weekend. I&rsquo;m hoping to get out on the Niner Air this weekend and get started on mountain biking. At some point, maybe next year, I&rsquo;ll plan another big bike trip. While riding the Katy we tossed around the idea of RAGBRAI, so, maybe we&rsquo;ll look into that. Finally, Thanks!: It is time to dole out the thank yous for this ride. First, to my father Bill Hammond, from myself, Mike and Dan, thank you for supporting us on the ride! Without you getting us there, meeting us each night, and hauling our gear, the ride would have been a lot more difficult! Second and Third, to Dan and Mike, thank you for joining me on this adventure. It was a great year of riding getting trained up for the ride. Without you guys I wouldn&rsquo;t have finished, thanks for putting up with me. To my wife, thank you for allowing me to do this! Next time you are doing it to like we originally planned! To my mother, thank you for watching the kids while I was off riding bicycles and Natalie was off playing Crossfit for the weekend. And finally, thank you to my brother Greg, the Niner bicycle was awesome!

    "body": "2017/01/29 - 2016 was a fairly down year for my biking, I think I only commuted to the office a handful of times, and my total mileage for the year was well under 1,000 miles. I&#39;m planning a couple of things in 2017 that will hopefully get me to exceed that poor showing (819 miles), and hopefully triple it, with an ultimate goal of riding 2,500 miles for the year. Considering it is January 29th already, and I&#39;ve yet to turn a crank once, I&#39;m already starting off behind! I need to do 200+ miles a month assuming I started on 1/1, since I likely won&#39;t actually ride until 2/1 or later, I&#39;ll have to turn 227 miles a month. That&#39;s actually a doable number, if I make time for it. How am I going to get to 2500 miles for the year? Well I&#39;ve got two, maybe 3, bike rides planned for the year.  Pedal The Cause 2017 (100 Miles, late September). Last year&#39;s Pedal I managed to finish the 100 mile route, but due to poor training, and a bad stomach, I did end up walking some, something I plan to avoid this year. Katy Trail (240+ miles, early October). &nbsp;A good number of the miles I put on the bike in 2016 were actually on the Katy Trail. For 2017 I could see that number being near 50%, okay, maybe not that high, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I do 800 miles alone on the Katy this year. I&#39;m organizing a group from ClubReady to ride the full Katy Trail in early October. We&#39;re still working out details on the route, but likely will start at either Clinton, or up towards Kansas City, and camp along the Katy Trail for the return ride. &nbsp;Prepping for both of those rides, the Katy ride likely being just 5 days after Pedal The Cause will get me out on the bike more this year than I have been in the past. I&#39;ve also sold my race car (again), so I won&#39;t be competing in Autocross near as much this year, which should free up some weekends for riding as well! As we prepare for the rides, I&#39;ll post up some of the details and training rides to get this whole thing working. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "

I&rsquo;m not the snot rocket kind of rider, have never even attempted it, as I know I would just get snot allover myself in the attempt, so most of my &ldquo;clearing&rdquo; goes the other way, which I easily dispose of to the side of the road with a targeted discharge from the kisser.

    "body": "2013/05/09 -  Last night Garmin was nice enough to send out an email to all Edge 500 users (assuming they sent it to anyone who has registered their device with Garmin. com). The email said there was an update available, and recommended that people perform the update by going to your dashboard on my. garmin. com. Long story short, I updated my device, but it failed. So I tried again, and it failed, this time bricking the device. I was unable to get it to power on, until I tried every button press combination possible until I was able to get it to give me something. I believe the proper combination of buttons is (Power+Menu+Lap) hold them down, then release all at once. If that doesn&rsquo;t work try holding all 4 buttons down and releasing. Ultimately I was able to get it to show me the Garmin splash screen, then it would scream (beep) and show me &ldquo;Software Missing&rdquo; on the screen. I found a number of different threads on Garmin. com regarding this, but had difficulty finding something that would actually work to help me get the device going again. First a warning: I take no responsibility for any damage you cause to your computer or Garmin by following these steps. I had backed up all my data before letting Garmin run the update, so I was covered, hopefully you did the same before your device bricked. Here are the steps I used, to restore my Garmin Edge 500 from the Software Missing message. : Download the ZIP file from this Google Docs page, under file choose download. Disclaimer, I didn&rsquo;t upload or create this, I just found it via this post on my. garmin. com&nbsp; While trying to follow the instructions in the Update. txt file I was unable to get Step 2 to work, so I have included my steps for this portion below.  Please extract the ZIP to a folder on your computer.  You should see two files, which are B103600K_0300. rgn and Updater. exex Rename Updater. exe With the device powered Off but plugged in to your PC, hold the button combo from earlier to get to the Software Missing screen. If your computer doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;beep&rdquo; as the device comes on, you might need to try again until Windows recognizes the device is there.  Drop the file B103600K_0300. rgn onto Updater. exe and select USB Device and click OK.  Wait until the device finishes loading software.  Now you should be able to disconnect the device and power it on like normal and it should have SW version 3. 00 loaded.  At this point I then got a corrupt message from Windows, asking if I wanted to repair the device. I chose to say no, and then I formatted the device via Windows with the following options  FAT file system (default) Allocation unit size 2048 (default) Volume Label GARMIN Quick Format enabled MS DOS Startup Disabled  Installed WebUpdater from Garmin to update the device www. garmin. com/webupdater Eject your device in Windows Remove from Computer Power Off Plug in to PC Run WebUpdater, find your device, and go through the update process I then went to the Garmin Dashboard and still had an update message, so I ran the process there as well. Hopefully that works for you like it worked for me. Now, the question is, why are Garmin Edge devices failing on this update? I think it is due to the bad sectors on the drive, being caused by unplugging the device from Windows without ejecting it first. At least, I hope that is it, I will be ejecting my Edge before disconnection every time (at least when I remember). If I was unable to restore my Edge 500, I was going to take it back to REI and exchange it (plus cash) for a new Edge 510, so while I am happy I was able to save it, I was a tad disappointed. "

    "body": "2012/10/18 - It is funny how two months can change things. On August 23rd I posted a blog entitled &ldquo;I still support Lance Armstrong&rdquo;, and at the time I meant it. But things have changed over the past two months. The first, and most important thing that changed my opinion was that I read Tyler Hamilton&rsquo;s book The Secret Race. It provides a very eye opening look into the world of cycling and the doping culture. It also provides some very opinionated insight into Lance Armstrong as a person. If you are at all interested in the story of the Postal Team, check out the book. I also recommend that you read David Millar&rsquo;s Racing Through the Dark. After I read Hamilton&rsquo;s book (finished it on the way to a conference last week) I really began to question my support of Lance Armstrong as a person. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still think Lance has done amazing things, they might take his titles away, but he still won the TdF 7 times. I also still believe that LIVESTRONG is a great organization, one which I continue to support, but I don&rsquo;t know that I can be a Lance Armstrong fan again until he mans up and takes responsibility for all of this. Last week with the Reasoned Decision that was released by the USADA, the cycling world, and Lance Armstrong&rsquo;s world has been flipped upside down. He has lost most of his major sponsors, and has stepped down as the chairman of the Lance Armstrong Foundation (LIVESTRONG). One of the most interesting things I have read in the past week, I read last night. Levi Leipheimer did an interview with the Press Democrat this week and talked about the events of the past week, and of course Lance Armstrong. What strikes me as the most interesting part of the interview (there are many interesting parts) is the discussion around his &ldquo;friendship&rdquo; with Lance. I remember back in 2009/2010 when Lance was riding and tweeting, he talked about Levi on a regular basis. But, as with Tyler&rsquo;s story, Levi basically says that Lance will cut you as quickly as he will befriend you. LL: It was never that. I think it&#39;s been a little overstated that we were friends. We were just colleagues basically. I find that to be very telling of the story of Lance Armstrong. It is all business, it is all about succeeding, winning, at all costs, friends be damned. I wonder how many others have been cut from the inner circle of Lance? I really don&rsquo;t care that Lance Armstrong, Tyler Hamilton, David Millar, Levi Leipheimer, George Hincapie and countless other pros doped. I think it was what you had to do back then to compete (I am not convinced that the current crop of riders are clean, hopefully time will tell). What I do care about is the lying. It is time to stop the lying, time to come clean, time to stop dragging people through the mud. Dear Lance Armstrong, Please come clean. For the sake of all of your fans, past fans, and cycling fans. Just admit it, let us all move on. I will forgive you if you do, I still want to be a fan, but I just can&rsquo;t right now, not without you owning your past. Sincerely, Chris Hammond "

    "body": "2012/08/24 -  Today is the day that Lance Armstrong packed up camp and went home. He has publicly announced that he is no longer going to battle with the USADA over the doping allegations. I don&rsquo;t know if he doped, I assume he probably did, but the proof never came out to say that he did. I don&rsquo;t like the fact that he might have doped, but the more I get into the sport of cycling, the more I read (recently finished David Millar&rsquo;s book and am just wrapping up Slaying the Badger) the more I understand that cycling was all about doping. To be honest, all sports apparently were about doping, and perhaps still are as two bay area baseball players have been suspending for doping in just the past few weeks. You know what, I don&rsquo;t really care at this point. If he did dope, he ran in a dirty race, beating other dirty riders, 7 times the Tour De France Champion, 7 times. You can&rsquo;t take that away from him, no matter what USADA says, what he did was amazing. What he has done since he was stricken with cancer is even more amazing, and that is why I don&rsquo;t care if he doped or not. He retired 3 years ago, let it go folks, let it go. Lance Armstrong, you are LIVESTRONG, and I will gladly ride again at a LIVESTRONG event in 2012. I raised over $4k this year, and I hope to more than double that next year. "

    "body": "2012/06/28 -  First things first. A HUGE HUGE HUGE thank you to every one of the individuals and companies that sponsored our fundraising for the event. Without your help Team ITM America wouldn&rsquo;t have raised $4,300 in total for LIVESTRONG. Also a big thank you for the largest donation from www. itm-america. com, they really helped us out with their donation and the KITs they outfitted us in! And now for the details. All the build up, all the riding, all the fund raising, and here we are, three days past the event. I am not sore. Natalie is not sore. Did we really just ride 100 miles? Well no, actually, we didn&rsquo;t, we rode 95. 8 miles, you can see the results on Strava right here. Unfortunately the ride wasn&rsquo;t a full 100 miles, but that was the design and layout of the course. Saturday morning Natalie and I said good-bye to baby Jacqueline, leaving her with Natalie&rsquo;s parents to watch her for the weekend. We drove up to Davis so we could get registered for the event, and then checked in to our hotel to relax a bit before we went to the fundraising dinner on Saturday night. Registration was pretty low key, we picked up all the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that we got, Natalie getting a t-shirt and water bottle, myself getting those items, plus a hat, bag, and LIVESTRONG jersey. Those items, along with two tickets to the fundraising dinner on Saturday night were my rewards for raising $4,015 for the event. We took a few moments to hang a few things on the dedication wall at the LIVESTRONG tent.  We checked out a few of the sponsor booths, picked up our Oakley Gift Cards, I got a cool Movember pin from the guys from www. movember. com, and then we headed off to find our hotel. We checked in to the Days Inn in Davis, CA on Saturday afternoon, and I tell you what we were in for an experience there. If you want to know all about it, go look it up on Yelp, I left a (not)nice review there. Here, I will just say, don&rsquo;t ever stay at the Days Inn in Davis California, it isn&rsquo;t worth your money. The dinner on Saturday night was great, while I actually didn&rsquo;t care for the food (I&rsquo;m a picky bastard so keep that in mind) Natalie enjoyed the meal. We had a great time talking to people throughout the evening. I think I enjoyed most hearing from the Texas 4000 riders, check them out at www. texas4000. org. They are heading from Austin to Anchorage, on their summer break! LIVESTRONG also had a guest speaker, Amy Dodson, her story was amazing to hear and nearly brought me to tears right there at the dinner table. After dinner we went back to the hotel to do some final preparation on the bikes and get our jerseys ready, I rode with the following attached to my back. I do have me some love handles, but in my defense there are 4 packages of HONEYSTINGER fruit chews, keys, a cell phone, cash and chapstick in my jersey pockets! The ride started off at 7:30am, we lined up for the start around 7:10 to try to get up front with the 100 milers. It was a tad chilly, Natalie could of used her jacket while we were standing around, but I had talked her out of taking it with her, as I knew once we got riding it would just be something extra to carry around. At 7:30 they sent the first wave off, we made it out in the second wave. Heading out of town they had the roads blocked off, so we could head out without stopping at any lights or stop signs for the first 3 miles. To be honest though, I don&rsquo;t think anyone stopped for a stop sign until well after mile 20&hellip; Fortunately most of the riding was done on the country roads of Yolo and Solano counties, so there wasn&rsquo;t much traffic. The ride itself was relatively flat, actually it was darn flat. If you notice the strava profile above you&rsquo;ll see it says we climbed 896 feet, over 95. 8 miles. That is nothing, in Hawaii a couple of weeks ago we did almost 4x that elevation in &lt;1/3 the distance, and riding around here in Half Moon Bay it is easy to put that on in a 12-15 mile ride. The weather for the ride was gorgeous, a bit cool to start off with, but it maybe topped out around 80 degrees (if that) during the ride. The wind did pick up a little here or there, but nothing that caused too much pain for the ride. This ride is a supported ride, which means there are water/bathroom/food stops all along the course, the first one being after 10 short miles. We decided that we wouldn&rsquo;t stop at the first one, we were only about 35 minutes into the ride by then, so we headed on to stop #2 at mile 24. The stops were all well stocked, except for #4 which was just a water tank, but you really can&rsquo;t complain because everything else was top notch. At the stops you could get water, gatorade, PBJ sandwiches, nuts, fruit and even HONEYSTINGER products, I&rsquo;m a fan of the stinger, so that was my favorite part. For the stops, we ended up skipping stop 1 and 3, but we stopped at the rest of them, it was nice to be able to get off the bike for a few minutes, expel some of the fluids we had been taking in, and grab a bite to eat without worrying about falling off the bike doing so. Ultimately we rested for about an hour and seven minutes according to the Strava route. The entire ride took us 7:10, with 1:07 of non-moving time. We managed to make the ride without any mishaps, no spills, no flats, nothing dropped or falling from the bike. At the end we rode across the finish line together, we probably could have (should have) gone another 2 miles out and back to get up to an even 100 miles for the day, but after a day of fighting off knee pain and trying to keep up with Natalie on the bike I was all for getting off and walking around a bit. Here&#39;s a short compilation video of some of our ride. After the ride we had some food, grabbed some drinks, and hit the road back to Half Moon Bay. I will go ahead and say it here now. I plan to do another, if not multiple, LIVESTRONG Challenge rides in 2013, even though we will not be in Northern California anymore (hello Missouri) I will plan to make the trip back out here if they hold one in Davis again. I would also like to try to see if I can raise enough money for Austin ($10k) next year, I have some ideas on how that can happen. I hope to build up a larger team next year, while it was fun riding with just me and Natalie, I think we could be far more efficient if there was a full team going the entire route shifting off duties of leading (Natalie did a lot of the leading due to my knee). If you are at all considering riding a 100 mile ride next year, considering joining the team. If you haven&rsquo;t touched a bike in years, never fear, I started riding just over year ago. I didn&rsquo;t put in any particular training plan for the ride, I just rode as much as I could starting in January, May really kind of tailed off besides our 100k ride and a 45 mile ride up in Vacaville, and June really didn&rsquo;t get enough riding until the event itself, but we faired pretty darn well I&rsquo;d say considering. Thanks to LIVESTRONG for organizing the event, thanks to Davis for hosting it (Davis is a great college town). Thank you again to all the donors for the event, thank you to my wife for riding it with me. And most of all because this was an event to raise money for LIVESTRONG and their cancer programs, this ride was for my best friend&rsquo;s mom Jan, my uncle John, my Auntie Carol, and my father Bill.

    "body": "2012/06/22 - It has been far too long since I&rsquo;ve blogged here on BicycleTips. com, hopefully I can pick up the pace here pretty soon. Natalie and I are just over 48 hours away from our 100 mile bike ride in Davis California for the Team LIVESTRONG Challenge. We both haven&rsquo;t ridden near enough in the past two weeks, but hopefully we are still ready for the ride. We did put in a training ride up in Vacaville a few weeks ago (strava route) and a climbing/raining ride in Maui during our vacation earlier this month (strava route). This afternoon at lunch I ran to REI and picked up some things for the weekend including: New gloves for me (old pair is pretty much falling apart) Bottle cages for Natalie (had to get a pair that matched the ones on my bike) Timbuk2 Goody Box Bike Accessory Case , after the 100k ride we did back in May (never blogged about that one, strava route) I have decided not to take a backpack, it was pretty much useless. This stem back from Timbuk2 will handle the few items I want to carry along. Park Tool Chain Gang Chain Cleaning System - CG-2 Chamois Butt&#39;r 10-Pack Skin Lubricant to try to fend of saddle soresThis evening I got home, cleaned and lubed Natalie&rsquo;s chain, and then used the Park Tool system to clean the chain on my bike (her chain was much cleaner as it has far less use on it). The Park Tool system worked amazingly, if you are looking for a chain cleaning solution for your bike, I highly recommend picking it up. (buy now Park Tool Chain Gang Chain Cleaning System - CG-2) We are heading up to Davis on Saturday morning, to get checked in, and get to our hotel for hopefully a good night&rsquo;s rest. We are staying at the Davis Days Inn, which happens to go for $1500/night (if you search on Priceline). We got a room for ~$75 using the name your own price, a savings of 95%! If you will be at #LSCDavis this weekend, feel free to find me and Natalie, we will be decked out in our Team ITM America kits! (See the kit) If you haven&rsquo;t donated to our ride yet, and are so inclined, please do so by clicking on one of our individual pages via the Team Page (http://laf. livestrong. org/goto/itmamerica).

    "title": "Riding from Parker to Denver in Colorado",
    "body": "2012/04/11 -  This post is a couple of weeks late, my fault, I know, been a busy time getting caught up from my trip, taking another trip, and planning a trip later this month. While I was in the Denver area I managed to rent a bike thanks to a friend (via twitter), and decided I wanted to go for a couple of long bike rides. Throughout the week I spent time looking at Google Maps and Strava to try to figure out what route I was going to ride. I had already planned to meet up with Joel from www. reasons2ride. com, so I wanted to find a route that worked out well with a place to meet him. I settled on a ride from Parker Colorado, north up the Cherry Creek trail, connecting west to the C-470 trail, out to the Mary Carter Greenway Trail north, connecting to the South Platte River trail (going north). From there the plan was to hear into Denver to the SAME Café, run by friends of mine. This route was going to be around 40 miles each way, longer in one direction than I&rsquo;ve ever ridden, so I was half worried that making it back to Parker might be an issue, so I had an out, a shorter way back leaving SAME Café and heading to the Cherry Creek trail, which would have cut about 16 miles off the return route. Friday after work, I was in Denver for the week providing custom DotNetNuke Training to a client, I stopped by the Littleton Bicycle Village store to pick up my rental bike that @Im_a_cyclepath hooked me up with. I took the front wheel off and put the bike into the back of my rental car and headed down to Parker. I stayed the weekend in Parker with our old neighbors, realizing quickly how much we miss them, we miss our house, and we miss Parker itself. It is a great little town, on the outskirts of the suburbs of Denver, but still close enough to get easy access to things. While the bike route to SAME was 40 miles, a drive would be somewhere around 25, maybe less. Saturday morning I got up early and planned to leave Parker at 8am. I was ready to go at 8am, but I chose to stick around the house for another 30 minutes, it was still rather chilly outside (40F), and I didn&rsquo;t bring my warm tights. I left the house at 8:30am, got on the bike and took off from the neighborhood on the south side of Parker. As I was leaving the neighborhood I realize that my Garmin Forerunner 305 Waterproof Running GPS (English &amp; French) was in running mode, instead of cycling mode. I quickly changed the mode, without stopping the recording, to biking. The device actually stopped recording, and started up a new recording when changing modes. I would later learn that this was going to be a problem. The device showed me the data, distance, etc from my ride, but wouldn&rsquo;t record the heart rate, or GPS location information, making the data itself useless. More on that later. The ride up to meet with Joel was fairly uneventful. The trail in Parker was essentially flat, though perhaps a little downhill. The trail going west on C-470 wasn&rsquo;t, lots of undulations, and roads that you end up having to cross, but being as early in the morning as I started there was very little traffic, both on the trail, and at the crossings. I met Joel at the junction of the Mary Carter and the South Platte River Trail, about 32 miles or so into my ride. We chatted for a few minutes and then got on our way towards SAME Café for lunch. We ended up taking mostly city streets up to the café, which slowed us down considerably, but provided a view of Denver that I haven&rsquo;t seen before. We had a great lunch at the Café, getting to eat with Brad, one of my fraternity brothers who runs the Café along with his wife Libby. Side note: Brad is running the Boston Marathon this month, Good Luck! Lunch was excellent, though I probably should have had another two slices pizza due to amount of riding I was doing for the day. SAME Café is a pay what you can establishment. I always pay extra, but enjoy every bit of helping out their organization. After lunch Joel wanted to show me around Denver a bit, and while Natalie and I lived in Parker, we were only there for ~8 months, so we really didn&rsquo;t get a lot of time to see the city as we were settling into our new home, and new neighborhood while we were there. We headed off to the State Capital for a photo opp (see right, and the header graphic above). We also headed over to the stadium that changes names too often, but can be referred to as Mile High. Joel is a season ticket holder for the Broncos, and even has a tattoo of the team logo, while I am a life long Chiefs fan. We took a photo in front of the Broncos statue outside of the stadium, you can see I am not near as thrilled about it as Joel was ;). This was the week that Peyton announced he was going to Denver, and Tebow was being traded to the Jets, so I headed into the stadium store to see if I could find a stuffed horse for the baby. There were a couple of things in the store that amazed me. 1) The Tebow gear was not on sale yet, even though he was traded, officially, unofficially, officially, by this point in time. 2) They didn&rsquo;t have a single stuffed horse in the store. There were monkeys, bears, and other stuffed animals, but not one horse. Hello? What is your mascot again? From the stadium we took the South Platte River Trail back towards the Mary Carter Greenway Trail. At the junction for the trail Joel and I sat and talked for about 30 minutes. He is riding the Ride the Rockies later this year, and I wish him all the luck in that! It is a much greater challenge than what I have coming up in doing the LIVESTRONG Challenge Davis century. After splitting off from Joel, I had another 30 miles or so left to ride back to Parker. At this point I had done around 50 miles, with my previous long ride being 37 miles, or thereabouts. I was feeling alright at the time, but my butt was definitely starting to get a little sore from being on the bike for so long. I made my way down the Mary Carter Greenway Trail, and as I came towards the C-470 junction my knee started to ache a bit, it was enough that I was apparently riding funny as well because another ride came up from behind me and asked if my knee hurt. He rode with me for a couple of miles, chatting, talking about riding, talking about what we do. He actually is a chef, but is between jobs, looking for something in food sales. He ended up leaving me as we headed up the C-470 trail, back towards Parker. He was a much stronger rider, and I could tell was slowing it down quite a bit to ride with me. One thing I realized, but didn&rsquo;t pay attention to, until the ride home, was that Parker is actually higher in elevation than Denver, so while there were hills on my morning ride, it was mostly downhill. That meant that going home I was going uphill the whole way. This slowed me down considerably. By the time I made it to the C-470 trail it was time to start taking breaks, mainly at the top of some of the climbs. I don&rsquo;t know how many breaks I actually took, but it was more than a couple! :) I learned something on my ride that Saturday in Denver. I make other people faster. At one point heading east on C-470 I was passed by an Asian rider, side note: with the biggest afro I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a guy on a bike. He actually passed me while I was stopped for a break at one point. Shortly there after though I got going and ended up passing him, not 15 seconds later he came flying by me. He must have been offended that he got passed by a 250lb fat guy on a bike that was just taking a breather on a hill. I ended up seeing him a few more times, and passed him again, but this time he was stopped to throw food to some of the prairie dogs that line part of the trail. I felt like telling him he shouldn&rsquo;t do that, but I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to do that. I made it back to Parker with the initial plan of driving up to Fort Collins that night so that I could stay with my brother, and go riding on Sunday. By the time I made it to the house in Parker though I crashed on the floor for an hour. My body was so tired I felt like I could hardly move. My arms were sore, my legs were dead, but not too sort, and my butt was killing me. I ended up deciding that I wasn&rsquo;t going to make it to FC that evening, and was going to be riding on Sunday. After about an hour I managed to pry myself off the floor, take a shower, and muster enough energy to head to dinner with Michael (neighbor) and then to see a movie as well. Sunday morning I took the bike back to Bicycle Village and then headed up to Fort Collins to see my brother and meet his girlfriend. Sunday evening we took bicycles over to Beau Jo&rsquo;s for dinner, I forgot how good their pizza is, and the crust with honey to dip in is excellent. I rode Greg&rsquo;s Surly Big Dummy, and have decided that it would be the perfect bike for hauling the baby around Half Moon Bay. I&rsquo;m looking for a used 20&rdquo; one if anyone knows of one for sale! Monday I headed off to the airport and returned to California, home for now, but I really feel like home is still in Colorado, even though we only lived there for 8 months. I will be back, I will. Earlier I mentioned that I had problems with the Forerunner. Well, fortunately I recorded my morning ride (screwed up) and my afternoon ride separately. This was fortunate because it meant the afternoon ride was recorded and had data, though for some reason it was truncated, showing only 36. * miles on Strava, when the Garmin showed 42 miles on the ride back. Total mileage for the day was right above 82miles. Not bad for a guy who had never done 40 miles before, and is accustomed to riding at Sea Level, rather than at 5600-5900 feet up. Here is the Strava profile for the return trip, due to the bad data the morning ride doesn&rsquo;t work on Strava.  "

    "body": "2012/04/03 - Here we are, day 3 into 30 days of biking (the month known as April). I came home from the office early today, left at 5pm, missing the Bay Area DotNetNuke User&rsquo;s Group meeting (www. baydug. org). I stopped by the lbs (www. bikeworkshmb. com)&nbsp; to see what they might have in terms of a road bike for my wife, she&rsquo;s 5&rsquo;10&rdquo; tall so that pretty much rules out most &ldquo;women&rsquo;s&rdquo; bikes, so I figured I would see what they had in a 56cm or so in men&rsquo;s. They had a couple of lower end Specialized Allez, similar to mine, but with lower end components. Unfortunately they don&rsquo;t appear to have much else right now, but I did figure out that they offer fitting services, so we will likely be scheduling that here in the next couple of weeks. I think she needs a 56cm, but I think we would be better off knowing for sure before buying. Pro Tip: If you visit Bike Works go upstairs, they have stuff up there too! After getting home I decided to just rest and take it easy, watch some TV before the wife and baby got home. I thought about riding, but decided that my sick body wasn&rsquo;t yet up to a long ride. I&rsquo;ve been fighting off a cold for two weeks, and this past weekend it struck me down, lots of coughing the past few days, I think I still have both lungs, but am not sure. After dinner I gave the baby a bath, side note: some how I have been tricked into this duty each night, for 1. 6 years I managed to avoid it! (to be honest, I enjoy bath time playing around with Jacqueline, so I can&rsquo;t complain). Once the baby was down I decided I should at least get out and ride a little bit around the neighborhood to have some actual riding for Day 3 of 30 Days of Biking. This is when karma struck, in the form of rain. Nonetheless I wanted to get something in, so I went out, riding the Cannondale with a red sox hat on (backwards) my jawbones on to cover the eyes, and my PI wind breaker to see if it was also water proof (it is not). I also got to test out my $1. 83 headlight that I picked up from the REI garage sale, it worked out rather darn well considering the cost. I put in 1. 8 miles, in windy chilly rain. Not ideal for a ride, but a ride it was.  "

Isn&rsquo;t Toddler366 enough for you Chris? No, it isn&rsquo;t. So what is 30 Days of Biking? Well, plain and simple, bicycling at least once, every day, in April 2012. Why? Why not. Biking is good for you, the more you do it, the better you feel, the better shape you are in. How much will you be riding? That depends on my schedule. Some days it will just be a quick ride around the neighborhood, some days I&rsquo;ll get in multiple rides. Hopefully every day I will get at least one ride in though, even if it is short. The difficult part for me is that I am likely going to be travelling to the east coast at the end of the month, and getting a ride in with that may prove hard, though I may try to ride a couple of times, even if short, with my good buddy Stephen Jones from www. velonation. com, but we&rsquo;ll see how that comes along. With each ride, assuming I ride with my Garmin, I will post up my Strava report from the ride. So here is Day 1&rsquo;s ride.  Yesterday morning we headed off to REI to see what we might find at the Garage Sale. We didn&rsquo;t plan on buying anything, but we had never been, so we went with open minds. Well, we scored. We ended up getting the iBert Safe-T-Seat Front Child Seat (Green,38-Pounds limit) for a steal, really, too low to even post about here! We immediately went home and tried putting it on my Cannondale Quick CX 1, unfortunately it wouldn&rsquo;t work on that bike, so we tried it on Natalie&rsquo;s Quick CX 3 and it did work. Jacqueline loves it! As you can see in the photo at the top of the post. "

    "body": "2012/03/12 - I am heading to Colorado next week for work, a week of onsite DotNetNuke Training in the state that is my former, if short lived, home. I booked my flights with the intention of staying over the weekend after working, so that I could go hit the slopes. It has been two years since I&rsquo;ve been on my snowboard, and I was hoping to get back on it. I made plans to go snowboarding this week here in Northern California, so that I could get the rust off here, before hitting the slopes in Colorado, but those plans fell apart today. Because of that I&rsquo;ve decided to not bother with taking the snowboard to Colorado, and instead started making plans to get some bicycle miles in while I am out there. My brother lives in Ft. Collins Colorado, having moved out there last summer, and he has plenty of bicycles, though I am not sure any of them will work for me to ride as he&rsquo;s 6&rdquo; shorter than I am. I hopped on twitter this morning and sent a message to Joel over at www. reasons2ride. com to see if he knew anywhere to rent a bike, and we ended up deciding that we would get together and ride while I am out there. We don&rsquo;t have the details worked out yet, but it will either be on Saturday the 24th or Sunday the 25th, and will likely start somewhere around Lakewood (where he lives), distance, length of time, route, etc still TBD. If you&rsquo;re interested in going for a simple group ride that weekend stay tuned as we get things organized. If you are in Denver area and have a road bike that will work for a guy that is 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; tall, and wouldn&rsquo;t mind letting me borrow it for a weekend, please let me know that too. I&rsquo;ll be looking into rental options as well. I will most likely be staying in Parker Colorado at our old neighbors house that weekend. Looking forward to being back in Colorado here soon! "

Well if that was good for a big guy like me, 2012 is going to be kickass! I hit 500 miles on the bike today for 2012, with 2 days left to spare in February. In January I did 256 miles, and for February I&rsquo;ve done 245. Of those 501 miles I&rsquo;ve climbed around 20930 feet, with 11,417 of that coming in February, and 3k of that coming on my ride up Tunitas Creek last weekend. I&rsquo;ve still got a long way to go in 2012, my big goal is the 100 miles at Team LIVESTRONG Challenge in Davis California on June 24. In addition to that I&rsquo;m doing a 100k with the Santa Rosa Cycling Club in May, and maybe even&nbsp; that 60k in Gilroy in April.

    "body": "2012/01/19 - One of the things that I&rsquo;ve been trying to do while riding is figure out how to record my rides, for a couple of reasons. 1) To create cool creative videos. 2) To document events, who knows what can happen on the road, having video proof could help out some day. I think I can safely say that #2 is a far better, easier to attain, idea, than #1. And when you come up with a reason that justifies #2, you likely have something worth using for #1. Why might I say that? Well it is pretty simple, bike riding video is rather boring. At least the video that my 34 year old ass is able to shoot while riding. Why? A number of reasons. I&rsquo;m just getting started with riding, having put on about 144 miles on a bike in the first 3 weeks of the year, last year I put just under 600 miles in total, and what I ride would be considered rather tame, at least, it is rather tame in my eyes. I don&rsquo;t do downhill mountain biking, I haven&rsquo;t done any group rides, it is just me, sometimes me and my wife, or me and a friend, riding. Mostly road, but occasional dirt paths and trails. Nothing exciting by any means. So the videos that come from that riding are to put it bluntly BORING. See the following video for example. This video is from last weekend, I went out to Orinda with a buddy of mine to ride, we rode 14. 5 miles, climbing 1. 6k feet, the most climbing I have ever done on a bike. Our average speed was 8mph&hellip; You can see where I am going with this, boring video! Though it does look a little more interesting when you compress that 1. 75 hours into 2 minutes.  and don&#39;t forget the video from a couple of months ago riding around Half Moon Bay, CA These videos were all taken with one of my GoPro Camera HD HERO2 Motorsports Edition CHDMH-002. What do you think? Is bicycle riding video boring in general, or just mine? "

    "body": "2012/01/10 - As I get more and more into cycling I am looking for more and more things to get my cycling. I live in Half Moon Bay, and while my wife has started to ride as well, it is hard for us to get out for long rides because we have a 15 month old baby (15 months today!, happy 15 months Jacqueline). While we get out occasionally with the baby in tow, we typically each ride solo. In that quest to find riding events and people to ride with, etc I stumbled on SF2G, a club (website) for people in the bay area looking for others to ride with. I believe it started out as a way to get people to ride their bikes from San Francisco City to Google, by some Google employees. It has grown into 1800+ members and a variety of different rides, along with members from a wide range of companies and locations. Every first Friday of the month they do a First Friday Friendly Frolic (FFFF) in which they go with a No Rider Left Behind policy. They leave from a designated location and head south on the &ldquo;BayWay&rdquo; which primarily covers the bayside trail, and the necessary side streets in order to make it all the way down to the Google offices and various others. I am going to try to ride with them starting this February, though in order for me to do this I am going to have to do things a little out of the ordinary. I don&rsquo;t have the legs (yet) to ride from Half Moon Bay to my office in San Mateo, much less up to the starting point for FFFF, so I am going to drive up to the Daly City Bart station, then ride Bart up to wherever I need to go to meet up with FFFF. Then ride along until Foster City, at which point I will jump off and head west to the DotNetNuke offices. This is a little backwards, out of the way, but it is something I feel like I should try to do. Then hopefully, after work, I can ride my back to the Milbrae Bart station, and then catch that back to Daly City to get my car. "

    "body": "2012/01/06 -  For 2011 I personally set 3 goals, you can read about them fully on my post from 1/1/2011. Basically they were to lose 30 lbs (goal weight of 255, I&rsquo;m a big guy), inline skate 100 miles (I do like me some skating, I&rsquo;m a freak I know this) and ride a bike 500 miles. At the beginning of 2011 the bike I had was a 2004 Diamondback XTS Moto, not exactly something you could see yourself riding 500 miles on (at least not me). So in June I picked up a Cannondale Quick CX 1 and began my journey. As I posted back in November, I met the goal of riding 500 miles on the bike, and I fully intended to hit the skating goal of 100 miles. I am sad to say however, that I didn&rsquo;t skate 100 miles, and I didn&rsquo;t lose 30lbs last year, more like 7lbs. The weight was a rather lofty goal, but skating was definitely doable. I did manage to skate ~55 miles, but I really fell in love with cycling last year, so the skating definitely fell by the way side. My final bicycling total for 2011 was 572. 36 miles, and while looking at other people&rsquo;s riding numbers, it isn&rsquo;t much, it was a great achievement for me, and hopefully a great start to many years of riding. For 2012 I am setting some new goals, but this time I am not going to say &ldquo;I want to lost the remaining 23lbs (I did lose/keep off 7lbs in 2011). I am not going to set any inline skating goals, while I hope to still skate some in 2012. I am also not going to set an official mileage goal, though I would think that 12-1500 should be doable with the other goals listed below. I am going to set the following goals, and hopefully they will help me towards getting in shape and losing weight, the weight is not the focus. With all of the following goals, I would hope that I can find some friends, or make some new ones, that want to participate with me. If so, please use the Contact form on the About page.  LiveSTRONG Challenge Davis Century Ride, Davis, CA, June 2012 (link) My primary goal is to participate in the LiveSTRONG Challenge in Davis California on June 24, 2012. I am planning to attempt the 100 mile ride that hot day in June, in order to do this, I have a lot of training to do. As part of the LiveSTRONG Challenge I am working to raise money to raise awareness and fight cancer, it hit close to home in 2011 as my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer. You can donate to my fund raising at http://laf. livestrong. org/goto/chrishammond I appreciate any and all donations, no matter how large or small! If you are interested in riding with me (please do) you can join Team DotNetNuke for the challenge, even if you don&rsquo;t want to ride the 100 mile ride, you can do a shorter distance as part of the challenge. Wine Country Metric Century, Santa Rosa, CA May 2012 (link) In May of 2012 I plan to partake tin the Wine Country Century (metric) put on by the Santa Rosa Cycling Club. I hope that this will be right in line with my LiveSTRONG training, 62 miles on a Saturday in early May. Registration for this opens in February 2012, so hopefully I can get in as there is a limit to the number of registrants. Tierra Bella 2012 60k, Gilroy, CA April 2012 (link) As prep for the above to events I hope to take part in the 60k route of the 2012 Tierra Bella bike ride put on by the Almaden Cycle Touring Club near Gilroy California. This will be around 35 miles. Registration is open, though I haven&rsquo;t yet registered as I am waiting to see if my wife is going to participate in this as well. Marin Triathlon (sprint), Marin County, CA, November 2012 (link) To close out the year, I am planning to participate in my first triathlon. I&rsquo;m not a runner, not really a fan of it, I used to swim a lot as a kid, so I am hoping that with the riding to get ready for the LiveSTRONG Challenge I will manage to get in shape enough that I can take part in and complete my first sprint triathlon. My wife is also likely going to do this one as well. Following my goals? Well, you can follow my rides and stats by checking out my Strava. com profile. I&rsquo;ll be doing another writeup here in the next week on strava. com and why I think it is the best website for tracking rides, and even finding new ones.

I went to bed around 11pm last night, read for a while, and tossed and turned until about 2am, I guess those cookies and milk at 9:30pm weren&rsquo;t such a good idea as the sugars kept me up. 6am came and my alarm went off, at first I turned it off and decided I would sleep in. Then I lay there thinking &ldquo;Get up you lazy ass, go ride&rdquo; so I did. I got up, and peered out the blinds to see what the sun was starting to do. It was dark outside, very dark, with no hint of sunshine. It took me a while to figure out when sunrise was scheduled, I should have checked last night. The default Weather/News app on Android 4. 0 doesn&rsquo;t tell you sunrise/sunset times, and the Weather channel&rsquo;s mobile site doesn&rsquo;t either, it took me quite a while finding it on their desktop site with my Galaxy Nexus. When I did find the time Sunrise this morning was at 7:25am, so basically I was up an hour too early. I do not yet have the gear for an early morning o-dark-thirty bike ride, in order to do that I need to get a good headlight and tail lights for the bike, as my previous contraption that I used for the Fourth of July isn&rsquo;t something I want to use on a regular basis. So I didn&rsquo;t ride this morning, instead I headed in to work early so I could perhaps get out in time for a quick ride this evening before sunset (which is at 5:04pm tonight).

I ended up with 1. 5 hours of video, rather than let you watch the entire boring (wind filled) ride, I took some of the clips and put them together into a short video. This ride was down Highway 1 (south), past the GoPro headquarters to the Cowell-Purisma trailhead, then west towards the water on the trail. Up the trail, a pretty flat ride except for the down and up through one of the gorges (canyons?), back to 1 at Cowell Beach. Back west on Poplar towards the beach, around the Poplar parking lot where the crew for Men of Mavericks (Iron Cross Productions) has a bunch of trailers and gear stored. From there I head north on the trail and back to our house. A few things about the video for anyone else looking to film your rides. Using a Skeleton case for the GoPro Cameras while riding a bike isn&rsquo;t recommended, the audio will come out bad, lots of wind noise (go figure), you can see this at the end of the video when I leave the camera audio in place. I might try the full case with the skeleton back door at some point, but haven&rsquo;t tried that yet. Mounting the camera to your helmet will provide a little extra, noticeable, weight on one side of your helmet, in the future I will likely try mounting it on top of the helmet instead of off to one side.

    "body": "2011/11/28 - I have attempted to set new years resolutions in the past, but I typically failed at them, and most times I failed quite early on. For this year I set 3 goals, 1 of them I am pretty confident I won&rsquo;t hit, more on that later, but two of them I had/have every intention of hitting. Goal #1 Drop 30 lbs I&rsquo;m a big guy, 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; and on 1/1/11 I weighed 255lbs. I think sometime shortly there after I crept up to around 260lbs. My goal for the year is 225lbs. Currently (as of this morning) I weigh 246. 2 lbs. I have been under 250lbs for about a month now. In the past 6 years (probably more) I haven&rsquo;t weighed under 250lbs for more than a day or two. So while I doubt I will hit 225lbs by 12/31/11, I plan to keep under 250, and would be happy if I was under 245 by then, closer to 240 would be preferred. Goal #2 Skate (inline) 100 miles I actually got off to a good start in January doing about 25 miles, but I haven&rsquo;t skated once since, that changes tomorrow. I plan to go skate over my lunch break, putting in probably 8-10 miles depending on the wind. I love to inline skate, I always have. I have a nice pair of K2 Radical Pro&rsquo;s (with some minor repairs to the cuff) that are waiting for me by the door so I don&rsquo;t forget them on my way to work. While I have 75 miles to go, if I can get in 2 skates a week for the next month I should be able to hit that 100 mile goal. In 2010 I skated 18. 6 miles, according to Garmin Connect, in 2009 I skated 116. 05 miles. Goal #3 Ride 500 miles on a Bicycle I am proud to say that I completed this goal today, in less than 6 months of actual riding! In 2010 I rode 93 miles on a bike, and prior to 2009 it had been YEARS since I rode a bike with any consistency. As a kid I rode a BMX bike everywhere, but pretty much nothing since I turned 14. So getting to 500 miles seemed like an pretty high, but still attainable goal. I didn&rsquo;t log my first mile on a bicycle in 2011 until May 30th. Pretty much 5 months of the year without riding, and then starting on 5/30 I got into riding. Why the change? Earlier that week I purchased a new bicycle, a 2011 Cannondale Quick CX 1. In the 5 months and 29 days since I have put 507. 35 miles on the bike! Here are some of the statistics from my past 6 months of riding (courtesy of Garmin Connect) Progress Summary Report for ChrisHammond Count:46 ActivitiesDistance:507. 35 mi Time:48:34:30 h:m:sElevation Gain:27,802 ftAvg Speed:10. 4 mphAvg HR:155 bpmAvg Bike Cadence:67 rpmCalories:44,451 C I won&rsquo;t set my goals for 2012 yet, as I still have another month to go for 2011, but I have some ideas as to what they will be!

    "body": "2011/11/02 - Last Wednesday I went for a ride at lunch time with a coworker of mine. I decided to take the GoPro Camera along with me for the ride, though not attached to the bike itself, or to me, I attached it to a 3 foot pole, that I mounted to the front of the bike. If you&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;boy, that sounds like it won&rsquo;t work&rdquo; you are correct. It didn&rsquo;t work out very well, the pole wasn&rsquo;t near stable enough for the camera, so it made for a very wobbly video of the ride. I still think it is interesting though, so I editing, sped up, slowed down, and uploaded it to YouTube. You can see it here.  &nbsp; As you can see the video isn&rsquo;t worth much. I took what I learned from the experiment and tried to create a better mount for my car for the autocross this past weekend. That didn&rsquo;t work out so well either, but you can read about that over on Project350z. com. After the ride we got back to the car, and I remember getting ready to remove my Garmin Forerunner 305 from the bike, but I don&rsquo;t think I actually removed it entirely. I did remove the camera from the bike, and put it in the car. Later that evening I went to look for the Garmin and it was gone, nowhere to be found. I looked throughout my car, looked around my desk at the office, in the garage at the office, and even went to the location where the car was parked. Unfortunately I was unable to find it I posted an ad on Craigslist in the Lost and Found section with the hope that someone would find it and return it, but I haven&rsquo;t been that lucky. Speaking of not being lucky, or just being stupid. Today I went and picked up another Forerunner 305 off of someone on Craigslist, with two chargers and a heart rate strap, for $85. I thought it was a good deal, until I got home and realized that the UP button on the Garmin doesn&rsquo;t work. I think it will still work for what I need, but I won&rsquo;t be able to do things like adjust the contrast. I&rsquo;m tempted to take it apart and see if I can fix it, but so far I haven&rsquo;t been able to get the Forerunner 305 to come apart. I should probably just leave well enough alone and use it as is. Lesson learned! Don&rsquo;t trust anyone selling anything on Craigslist, always test something before you buy it. "

    "title": "My foray into (clipless) clipped pedals",
    "body": "2011/10/19 - First things first, I had no idea why they are called clipless pedals, and I still doubt the reasoning I read. I am actually going to call them CLIP pedals, because that is what they really are. More on that later. So, I went to a pedal other than a standard platform, and boy am I glad I did! A couple of weeks ago I ordered a pair of shoes with the intention of getting some pedals to go along with them, Friday the pedals arrived. Saturday the wife and I (and baby) went to the pumpkin festival here in Half Moon Bay, taking the baby and trailer for the two mile drive to avoid sitting in traffic for which likely would have taken 30+ minutes. I didn&rsquo;t want to try the new pedals for this trip, so I waited until Sunday to install the pedals. I ordered Shimano PD-M520L MTB Sport Pedals with Cleats from Amazon on Thursday with my free 2 day shipping via Amazon prime, they showed up early, score. Here are a few shots of the pedals installed on the bike, and my shoe hanging there as I played around with things.   Installation of the pedals was easy, everyone says you need to use a pedal wrench, but I managed just fine with a 17mm Craftsmen wrench from my toolbox, just as I did when I travelled with the bike a few weeks ago and boxed it up for the airplane. Once I installed the pedals fully loosened the clips on the pedals so that exit from the clips would be very easy, I have had plenty of people tell me that clipped pedals will be a new experience and I will likely fall. I figured having things as loose as possible would help to minimize that risk. I tested the process out a bit, without actually wearing the shoe. I made sure I understand how the shoe went in, and how it came out of the clips. Going in is fairly straight forward, and as I began riding it became very easy to do. Put the front in first, then push down. Getting out of the clipped pedals was just about as simple, just turn your foot left or right and you&rsquo;ll come free. I immediately put my shoes on and started riding around in a circle in our front yard (grassy) to test things out and see if I could manage to get in and out without trouble, all was well. From there I got changed, put on my bicycle shorts (sans underwear) and headed out for a ride. I took off down Highway 1 early afternoon on Sunday, traffic was a bit busy from folks trying to get out of town after the pumpkin festival, that actually made for easy riding, the cars weren&rsquo;t moving as fast as usual down one. Leaving the neighborhood I came to my first stop sign, in and out of the pedals without any issue. After heading about 6 miles up 1 I turned off at the Moss Beach Distillery and decided to head up into the trails around Pillar Point, climbing a fairly steep asphalt incline, and then lots of dirt, all without trouble in the pedals. So why would anyone want to use clipped pedals on a bicycle? Holy cow! They make a huge difference. The best thing I heard before using them was &quot;instead of just pushing, your legs now push and pull&quot; until I heard that I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why people used them. That makes a huge difference, instead of your legs just pushing down on the pedals, they can now pull up. Sitting at a stop light or stop sign, I typically take one foot out of its clip, leaving the other in place. With the that foot clipped in, I can easily reposition the pedal for prime launch, rather than having to stick my toe under the pedal and try to flip it backwards into the right location. But that isn&rsquo;t the only pulling, and to be honest, that is really just a convenience. The real benefit comes into play when you are really getting into a ride, you get both legs working, not just on the downward stroke as with a standard pedal, but now going the complete revolution you can work the legs. I definitely felt that difference when I was riding, and I am still feeling it today, but it is a good sore! I look forward to riding again later this week so I can feel it again. So, back to the &quot;clipless&quot; thing. Well apparently &quot;clipless&quot; pedals refer to the fact that these types of pedals don&rsquo;t contain a strap or basket for your foot to go into. They do &quot;clip&quot; in place on the pedals, so I say screw it, I&rsquo;m going to call them clipped pedals, I think you should to. Have you tried clipped pedals yet? Do you ride without them? "

    "body": "2011/09/13 - So this is actually a very common question on the internet, and why would I post about it? Because I had the question, and I had to spend time looking it up and reading, so for all of you newbies (like me) who are getting into biking, the question stands. Do you wear underwear with bicycle shorts? The short answer is NO. The longer answer follows below. So why did I even have to ask the question? Well since we started riding Natalie and I have both have realized that wearing padded shorts, otherwise known as a chamois, is a must. While a chamois doesn&rsquo;t make all the un-comfortableness of a bike saddle go away, they help greatly, as in, TONS. When you start riding, padding or no padding, you are going to be sore, no ifs ands or buts, alright, maybe some buts. I found that with consistent riding most of that goes away, a week or two, maybe a little more. But every time you ride, unless you have a big cushy seat, you&rsquo;re going to have some discomfort, that is where the chamois comes in. So when I started riding I got some padded shorts, sort of a liner (removable) for a pair of mountain biking shorts, I just assumed that you also put underwear on beneath it. I picked up another pair of shorts, and a bib as well, with each I wore underwear. When I was in Lincoln Nebraska a few weeks ago, I rode 17 miles around a 3. 25 mile loop, round and round I went, and sore and sore I got. I wasn&rsquo;t sure why, but I had the thought that it was likely the seam on my boxer briefs causing the issue. So yesterday, Natalie and I went to ride, towing the baby behind us. Before we headed out I decided I would ride with just the shorts on, no underwear underneath. I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what to expect, but I tell you what, WAYYYYYYY more comfortable! Now, with that in mind, be sure to wash your shorts and chamois frequently! There are also products like chamois butt&rsquo;r that you can apply to both the chamois and your rear end. I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what they were for, until I figured out this whole underwear thing! Paceline Products Chamois Butt&#39;r Eurostyle So, back to the question in case you missed it above! Do you wear underwear with your bicycle shorts? NO! "

When I finally got around to setting up this BicycleTips website I stumbled across another guy who started blogging this year about biking. Joel over at at www. reasons2ride. com has a great website coming along. Be sure to head on over and follow his progress. In short, Joel got fed up with his life, his weight, and decided to change things. Something I completely understand. I have a very similar goals, to get in better shape, and to lose weight. Bicycling is my method to achieve those goals, just as Joel&rsquo;s. Though Joel has had more success on the weight loss front, I am not at all disappointed in my improvements so far. I&rsquo;m definitely in better shape than I have been in a while, and I think I am finally slowly starting to lose some of that weight. Another reason I like reading Joel&rsquo;s posts, besides the progress he is making with his personal fitness, improving life, he&rsquo;s from Denver. He even recently attempted his first 14er, something that Natalie and I had planned to get doing (trying to hit as many of the 14ers as we could) before we abruptly moved from Colorado to California. If we still lived in Parker I would head over and go riding with him. Maybe one day when we move back to Colorado I will. Now, where are all my bicycle tips? Well, life has been busy! I&rsquo;ve been on the road for 2. 5 weeks out of the last 3, so I haven&rsquo;t had a whole lot of time to ride, though on our last trip down to Los Angeles I did manage to get about 50 miles in over three rides, 1 of which was a 30 mile ride with my wife. I&rsquo;m a tad sore from that one, but looking forward to doing that again soon. "

She had a doctors appointment last week and the doc said it was okay to start pulling her behind the bike in a trailer if she&rsquo;s strong enough to sit herself up. So we took the opportunity today to do just that. We loaded up the bikes and trailer, and headed over to Bicycle Sundays on Cañada Road in San Mateo County. Basically on most Sundays they shut down a 2. 5 mile stretch of the road south of highway 92, for biking. It is a nice smooth surface, and a safe place to ride, there are tons of folks out there. A few things.  Always make sure your bike trailer is in top shape, remember what you have sitting in there, you&rsquo;d hate to have something happen to your child! Be prepared for a work out! Watch out for rattles. No, not baby rattles, or rattlesnakes, just noises. More on that laterBeing the first time I&rsquo;d towed anything behind a bike, I didn&rsquo;t really know what to expect. I did spend the morning make sure all the attachments were sound, and ready for the ride. I then took about 35 pounds of weight and put it in the trailer and rode around the neighborhood. All seemed to go well, so I was comfortable putting the baby in there, with her helmet of course. The first thing I noticed, pulling a trailer is pretty straight forward, the only thing I really noticed was the extra weight, and the rattles. The rattles I will take care of though with some strategically placed tape (probably hockey tape as I have some around). The rattling was primarily occurring on the trailer where the safety pins go in to hold things together, a little tape I think will keep them in place and reduce the rattling noises. It didn&rsquo;t appear to bother the baby at all, but it sure annoyed me! As for the weight, it felt like I was towing a parachute around behind me, especially when going into the wind. Speaking of wind, we had the mesh screen down, but not the plastic window, the wind didn&rsquo;t seem to bother the baby one bit. We rode about 10 miles today, it sure seemed like one of the hardest workouts I&rsquo;ve had on the bike yet, I am sure that is due to the baby, but also due to the fact that around the house in Half Moon Bay we pretty much ride on flat ground, where Cañada road had some elevation changes to it. What are your tips for towing a child behind your bike? "

    "body": "2011/07/23 - So I finally got around to trying out the IMapMyRide application on my Android phone today, along with my Garmin ForeRunner 305 which I always use when I ride. Overall, I would say the application itself is pretty slick, nice interface, different than SportsTrackLive, though I am not sure it is any better yet. One thing I was shocked, and perhaps I should have just done more research, is the limitations that MapMyRide has on their website, unless you are a paying member. In their defense, SportsTrackLive is also a paying thing, for their Pro version, but honestly I paid once and that was it. I purchased the &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; app in the Android Marketplace for $4. 84, to be honest, I had to look up the price, I couldn&rsquo;t recall what it was. Less than $5. MapMyRide has multiple pricing schemes, free gets you the basics, unlimited routes, workout tracking, calendar, and charts. Paying gets you &ldquo;printed maps&rdquo;, though I have no idea why you would want/need those, 1/4/12 fitness reports per year, removes Ads from the website, and lets you setup 3/5/unlimited training plans. The pricing goes from $6/month all the way up to $20/month. That $5 one time fee so far from SportsTrackLive is pretty attractive at those prices. When I completed my ride, uploading the track on MapMyRide was quick and easy, it did appear to be far faster than SportsTrackLive has been in the past. The MapMyRide website is 100x prettier than STL, though I am having trouble trying to see how I can change my recent route from Private to Public. I believe I set it to private when I finished the ride, with the intention of updating it once I got on the computer and verified the information. Anyone got any tips for that? So, as of right now, I don&rsquo;t see MapMyRide taking my riding program anywhere that SportsTrackLive can&rsquo;t, but I will give it a few more rides and see how things play out. I can assure you that Garmin Connect won&rsquo;t be leaving my stable of software anytime soon. As I play with these other tools, GC keeps track of all the rides so I have somewhere to go to get all the data, in one place. "

Not having any spares around was the first lesson, always have some extras! So on Monday I ran out and picked up 3 tubes, between mine and the wife&#39;s bike I hope 3 will last us a little bit. I realized I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever changed a bike tire before, so I figured, I may as well stick a camera up on the wall and film the process. I also took the camera out into the garage while I put air in the tire, but the lighting was so bad I didn&#39;t bother doing anything with that part of the video. So here it is, our first video for BicycleTips. com, I promise future videos will have higher production quality! This was just last minute thrown together and edited.  The video was recorded with a GoPro Hero camera, highly recommended! "

So I had to do a little digging and see what the term means. According to the urban dictionary, Bicycle Legs is used to basically refer to banged up shins. So I can proudly, or shamefully, say, that I too have bicycle legs. While riding a couple of weeks ago, coming up to a stop sign to get onto Highway 1 here in Northern California, I managed to somehow miss the pedal completely and skinned up my shin. It is just now about healed. What is your worst Bicycle Legs story? "

    "body": "2011/07/17 -          So this isn&rsquo;t going to be a long tip, as this topic will likely fill out future tips as well, but for now I will raise a question. How do you track your rides? Or, do you track your rides? At this point in time I use Garmin Connect and SportstrackLive. com. Why do I use both? Well I have a Garmin Forerunner 305 that I use, mounted to the handlebars on the bike, with a heart rate monitor and cadence monitor. It tracks things rather well, bit I figure having two sources of data can&rsquo;t hurt. For SportstrackLive I use my Motorola Droid, running Android 2. 2. 2. SportstrackLive works alright, though I haven&rsquo;t bothered to get any attachments for it (heart rate, or cadence). I find that I like the Garmin website interface better than STL, but to be honest, both of them leave me wanting more. I feel like I should get more out of the websites. Neither of them seem to provide me anything along the lines of &ldquo;hey someone else rides the same place you do&rdquo;. Being that my wife and I are just getting into the bicycling thing, I wonder if riding would be more interesting (not that it isn&rsquo;t right now) if we rode with other people? Someone to push/pull us along? Watching the Tour this year, I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of advertisements for MapMyRide, but I&rsquo;ve yet to try the software out yet. Anyone have any experience/opinion on it? I do find that having the data drives me to ride more. I like being able to run reports on my riding to see that I&rsquo;ve put in 161 miles since May 1st. "

If I can get the time I&rsquo;ll try to put in at least 25 miles between the two days. I have yet to try to hook up my GoPro camera on the bike yet, I use it fairly heavily when autocrossing my 350z. I was going to hook it up last weekend but ended up not coming up with a good mounting system. I see that REI carries a Helmet Front Mount as well as a Handlebar/Seat Post Mount for the GoPro. I&rsquo;m not too keen on doing the helmet mount, I can only imagine the extra weight that would add. Another thing I might try is the Chest Mount Harness for the GoPro. I&rsquo;ve used my GoPro for quite a bit of timelapse at various events, the chest harness would come in handy for that, and possibly riding? What are your bike plans for the weekend?

It&rsquo;s bulky, could get lost, or who knows what else. Last year while watching the Tour de France I saw advertisements for RoadID and I though, what the heck is that for? Well, this year as I started riding I quickly figured it out. What would happen if I got into an accident while I was out riding, sans wallet. What if I was unable to speak, how would anyone know who I was, where I lived, or how to get in touch with my wife and baby? They wouldn&rsquo;t. So I decided to start carrying my driver&rsquo;s license when I rode, but that didn&rsquo;t actually help either. We recently moved, so the address on my driver&rsquo;s license was no longer correct, and it sure didn&rsquo;t have any other way to get in touch with my family listed on it. Enter RoadID. With RoadID you have a bracelet that you can wear, and when you order your RoadID you get to customize what it says on it. I put the following information on my RoadID. CHRISTOPHER J HAMMONDHALF MOON BAY, CA USAWife ###-###-####Home ###-###-####NO KNOWN ALLERGIESWWW. CHRISHAMMOND. COM Now, hopefully if I am ever in an accident on the road, I am identifiable! Though I guess I lied about the no known allergies part, there was this swimsuit that I wore as a kid, it changed patterns when wet. That damn thing gave me hives, not fun. So when you ride, be sure to carry some form of ID that can be found easily. You definitely don&rsquo;t want to be a missing person or a John/Jane Doe! Get your RoadID today! "

    "body": "2011/07/04 - So today is the Fourth of July, and what is everyone going to be doing tonight? Going to watch Fireworks of course. The wife and I are as well, though we are leaving the baby at home with her Nana for the evening. Here in Half Moon Bay, CA there are fireworks scheduled over in El Granada, which is about a 3 mile bike ride for us. So, with the goal of trying to avoid some of the traffic chaos that I can imagine will consume Highway 1 tonight, we are going to try to bike to a location where we can see the fireworks. We&rsquo;ll head out early, when the sun is still up, and try to get a spot on the beach somewhere, but coming home we need to be prepared for the darkness. I went to REI today after my autocross race (read about that over on Project350z. com) to look for a couple of things. First, I wanted to get a good setup so we could lock our bikes if we ended up having to put them somewhere while we watch the fireworks (I&rsquo;ll be taking my camera/tripod so we may have to walk around a bit). Second I wanted to see what their options were for lighting for the bikes. They had all sorts of options available, from cheap, to really expensive. I wasn&rsquo;t too keen on the idea of spending a couple hundred dollars EACH BIKE for a light, so I just purchased two rear red LEDs (Planet Bike Superflash Rear Bike Light) that either light up, or flash depending on the button press. I then had a brainstorm to try something with some flashlights that we each got for Xmas. They are some very bright white LED lights, and have a strobe option as well. I figured I could come up with a way to mount them on the front of the bike fairly easily. I got home this evening and started looking at how I was going to mount them. First I was going to try to use some of the mounts from the rear LED that I didn&rsquo;t need because of the way we are mounting the rear lights to our bags. That didn&rsquo;t quite work out the way I intended, but while trying it out I realized I could use the front reflector to mount the light. I ended up removing the front reflector completely from my bike, and then using the mounting bracket for it, along with two black zip ties, to attach the flashlight to the bike. I&rsquo;ll have to take this out for a ride tomorrow and make sure it will stay attached, I would hate to lose the flashlight and go dark while riding! Before we head out I will trim the zip ties, I just left them for fitting purposes for now. If you live in California, I believe (check for yourself) that it is law that you must have a white light on the front of your bike that is visible from 300 feet away. Though after I do a quick read of that page (linked) it looks like you may still need a light on your person, even if you have one on the bike? It actually reads like, if you have on on you, you don&rsquo;t need one on the bike. Anyone have a take on that? Always check your local laws before biking and be sure you know the rules! "

    "title": "Getting a bike to ride, here’s our story",
    "body": "2011/07/01 - So our story began a while back. We&rsquo;ve talked of getting bikes so that we could start riding. By a while, I think we&rsquo;ve talked about it for 3 or 4 years? My brother is &ldquo;in the industry&rdquo; or used to be, so I had visions of getting deep discounts on something really cool. Before we get into the selection, a little background on me. As a kid I was always on a bike, but only a bmx style bike, never a road bike, never a &ldquo;10-speed&rdquo; as we called them back then, never a mountain bike. Though I did pick up a mountain bike for $25 in high school, I honestly think I rode it home, and then likely never again. I never rode for competition, it was always for fun. Last spring I drove down to Southern California (from the San Francisco Bay Area) and picked up two things from my brother. One a Suzuki SV-650, and the other being a 2004 Diamondback XTS Moto (pictured). I rode it last summer before we had our baby, I put about 111 miles on it from June through September, 98% of that being on flat bike/walking trails in Belmont and San Carlos, CA. The bike was overkill for that, and the only time I tried riding it up a hill near our old house I couldn&rsquo;t keep the front end on the ground, a full suspension bike is definitely not what I need. So, we had the baby in October, we moved to Half Moon Bay in May and we decided it was time to get ourselves some bikes to ride. I actually decided to buy my wife a bike before myself, for her Mother&rsquo;s day gift. I tried to go to REI and get her one the night before the holiday but they pretty much shut me down. They said I could buy one, but I shouldn&rsquo;t, I should bring her in and get her fitted for a bike. So on mother&rsquo;s day we headed over to REI to let her get fitted. More on what she got later. While looking at bikes there for Mother&rsquo;s Day the staff at REI basically asked, what kind of riding do you want to do? Well, all kinds? So the question becomes, what kind of bike should we get. Basically since we were starting out riding, we wanted something that we could ride on paved trails, as well as unpaved trails. More so on the paved then unpaved. That being said, they suggested a hybrid setup for us. A hybrid bike is a bike that looks and seems like a road bike, but isn&rsquo;t quite a road bike. They tend to have a similar geometry to a road bike, but a front fork (suspension) and not quite road tires. This allows for a road like feel, but also the comfort/ability to go off the beaten path without fearing for your life (though I can only assume the fear part as I&rsquo;ve never been on a road bike, much less one in dirt). For Natalie we ended up getting a Cannondale Quick CX 3. It has turned out to be a great bike for her so far, putting just about 50 miles on it. It&rsquo;s white/black and red, and has a front fork that can be locked into a solid configuration. Having a front fork that can go into a locked out position is very handy when riding on pavement. Though the Quick CX 3 isn&rsquo;t the easiest thing to lockout while riding, it can be done. For myself, I liked the Quick CX lineup, like Natalie&rsquo;s, but I decided I wanted to one up her! So I went and got the Cannondale Quick CX 1. What&#39;s the difference between the CX 1 and the CX 3? To be honest, not too much, and probably not enough to justify the cost, but hey, I enjoy my bike. The two biggest differences are 1) the CX 1 is a bare bike, no paint, just a clear coat over the metal. 2) instead of a dual shock setup on the front fork, the CX 1 has a single headshok. This actually makes it VERY easy to lockout while riding, and I frequently find myself locking and unlocking the suspension based on the surface. I&rsquo;ve put 90+ miles on my Quick CX 1 in the past month, since I got it, and I must admit I think it is a great bike. I&rsquo;ve done quite a bit of road riding, and some double and single track riding. It has performed great for all of it. I need to get the bike in to REI so they can do the free tune-up that comes with bike purchases. They recommend you ride it for a while, I think around 100 miles, then bring it in to get things tightened up. One of my goals for biking though is to ride enough to justify getting a road bike. I may end up selling that Diamondback XTS, if I do, I&rsquo;ll use that money to get a road bike. I&rsquo;ll definitely keep the hybrid though as well, I love having the ability to ride some of the trails here in Half Moon Bay. I also plan to use it when we start putting our daughter in the trailer and take her for rides, but that is a whole other blog post (or series of) down the road. So what is the tip for today&rsquo;s post? Tip: What size bicycle is right for you?: Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t know enough yet to tell you the answer to that question. Hopefully over time I will be able to tell you more, but for now, here&rsquo;s what I can tell you. I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; tall, and wear 34&rdquo; inseam pants, I got an XL for myself. I would recommend if you are looking to get into riding that you go to your local bike shop (LBS) and get fitted for something. I found that REI was very helpful, I didn&rsquo;t hit a local small shop, but I will definitely check some out here as I look to expand my stable. Before buying the bikes at REI, I really wanted to get my brother to get me a bike, on a sweet deal. At first I was a little hesitant, no offense to REI, but they don&rsquo;t tend to have the cheapest prices around. I purchased Natalie&rsquo;s bike for $699 (I think that was the price) and started to regret that a week later when their annual member&rsquo;s sale took effect and ALL bikes were 15% off. I went back to REI with the receipt in hand, and they, no questions asked, refunded the difference. That right there sold me on REI. I had no doubts about going to buy my bike from REI after that, and I got mine on sale as well. "

In the past 4 weeks, since getting my new bike, I&rsquo;ve put 95. 32 miles on the bike, and on my legs. For the first couple of weeks that riding was once a week, though I am trying to up that frequency. Two weekends ago I rode twice (Sunday/Monday for ~25 miles total), and then this past weekend I rode three times (three days, ~36. 38 miles total). I could definitely feel my legs on our ride yesterday afternoon. At least I think I could feel my legs, that or it was a lot windier than it had been for my previous rides, maybe it was both. Today, at work, my legs feel tired. Worn out, ready to relax. So I decided I wouldn&rsquo;t try to ride after work tonight. I planned to take tonight off, and then ride tomorrow.
