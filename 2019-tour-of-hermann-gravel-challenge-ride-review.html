										One day I'll get better about these write-ups so that I make
										myself do them the day of the ride, or the day there after,
										when everything is fresh in my mind. That being said, the
										2019 Tour Of Hermann Gravel Challenge was only 9 days ago,
										and it is still pretty fresh in my mind!
									</p>

									<p>
										Hermann Missouri is just a little over an hour drive from my
										house here in Wildwood, and I've never been there before.
										The closest I've been was the 2017 Katy Trail ride in which
										we passed north of Hermann on the trail, we definitely saw
										signs for Hermann, but that was towards the end of Day 2
										(112 miles that day) and I was not at all interested in
										taking an off trail detour.
									</p>

									<p>
										The Tour Of Hermann Gravel Challenge was put on by the
										<a href="https://www.alpineshop.com/" target="_blank"
											>Alpine Shop</a
										>, a store with a big local presence and great owners who
										support all sorts of outdoor activities. The event is a two
										day ride, typically with 3 &ldquo;Loops" on Saturday, and 2
										&ldquo;Loops" on Sunday. This allows riders to be selective
										about the distance that they ride. I went into the weekend
										with the plan of riding 2 loops on Saturday (~66 miles) and
										1 loop on Sunday (~50 miles). You can pick up your
										registration packet, T-Shirt, route maps, etc before the day
										of the ride, a buddy of mine from work went with me on
										Thursday before the ride and picked up our packets.
									</p>

									<p>
										The weather leading into the weekend was sketchy, with lots
										of rain heading into the weekend. Flooding in Hermann caused
										the event HQ to change locations from the City Park to a
										local elementary school, overall this ended up working out
										great, there were no issues that I could see from the
										location change. When the event started the weather ended up
										being nearly perfect. It was a tad chilly,&nbsp; but about 5
										miles into the first loop everyone was stripping off their
										outer layers, including myself. Right before we left on the
										ride I tossed my wind cover into my backpack, and at the top
										of the first climb I stopped to take off my sleeves, really
										I stopped to rest, but the sleeves made for a good excuse.
										To get North out of Hermann you end up crossing over two
										rivers, and then head west on the Katy Trail. If you haven't
										ridden the Katy before, check it out, and check out our
										<a

										The first climb off the Katy was paved, but most of the rest
										of the first loop was beautiful gravel. I got to do my first
										(few?) water crossing, and got this great photo from Dan
										Singer of my reaction going across:
									</p>

									<p>
										The first loop was just over 30 miles, wrapping back into
										Hermann back to the elementary school. This provides a good
										opportunity to stock back up on supplies, food and drink,
										and prep for the next loop of the day. At this point I
										should mention that I was riding with a car racing buddy of
										mine. We've both aged and started riding bikes, one of us
										still races cars, and the other rides his bike more. I'm old
										and slow on a bike, but watch out when I'm driving my car.
									</p>

									<p>
										Chris and I had ridden together most of the first loop, but
										at the break in between I told him not to worry about
										waiting for me, feel free to head out and ride at your own
										pace. We started the second loop, first having to try to
										figure out which direction to go (initial turn wasn't marked
										well) but once we got going we quickly figured out that we
										were in for a big climb. This time we were heading south of
										town, and climbing straight up on a paved road. I ended up
										being the slow man on the hill, taking my time climbing, and
										then getting harassed my some local kid in a white dodge
										pickup truck. He very kindly drove by, slowed next to me and
										yelled &ldquo;You're going to get killed". I less than
										respectfully yelled &ldquo;Thanks buddy". He stopped in the
										middle of the road and yelled &ldquo;What'd you say" and I
										responded &ldquo;THANKS". He then drove off. I have a little
										bit of a temper on the road, doesn't matter if I'm on a bike
										or in a car unfortunately.
									</p>

									<p>
										I didn't get a good look at the truck, I wish I had, up the
										hill I saw a gray/white dodge parked in a lot, with a
										particular logo on the side of it. I knew the logo as a
										friend of mine works for the company, but the driver was
										nowhere to be found, so I couldn't be sure that it was the
										same truck that stopped to harass me, otherwise I was going
										to vindictively reach out and try to cause that guy some
										personal pain. I'm sort of glad I didn't see enough details,
										I finished my ride, I didn't die, no need to try to get that
										guy fired&hellip;
									</p>

									<p>
										The first loop Saturday had around 2,000 feet of climbing,
										the second loop had more than that, and was far more
										struggle than I had planned on it being. Here's the
										elevation profile for Day 1's first two loops.
									</p>

									<p>
										<img

										/>
									</p>

									<p>
										By the time I had finished loop number 2 on Saturday, I knew
										there was no way I was going to attempt loop 3, and at that
										point I was pretty sure I was done for the weekend and would
										not be returning on Sunday. It was about 230pm when we
										finished the ride, after sitting around for a while chatting
										I decided it was time to pack up and head home. I had
										initially thought I would stick around Hermann for the
										evening and enjoy the included dinner/prizes, but by this
										point in the day I was ready to just head home. I managed to
										make it home around 5pm and unloaded the bike from the car.
										I washed it off and then decided I was going to take it easy
										and watch the Kentucky Derby from the comfort of my bed. I
										managed to make it right up until they got the horses in the
										gates, and then I passed out. I woke up 15 minutes later and
										had to quickly rewind to see the results of the race, after
										all the chaos of the disqualification I wasn't ready to
										sleep anymore so I got up and headed down to the garage.
									</p>

									<p>
										I decided at that point in time that I was going to make it
										back to Hermann on Sunday morning to do Loop 4 as I had
										originally planned, so I spent a bit of time getting the
										bike ready again. With the water crossing in the wash I
										needed to get the chain lubed up and make sure everything
										was in working order.
									</p>

									<p>
										Sunday morning I got up early and headed in to Hermann, on
										the way there I distinctly remember thinking &ldquo;I should
										have my radar detector in, I would be very pissed if I got a
										speeding ticket in one of these little small Missouri towns,
										and then I would never want to come back to whatever town it
										was". Less than 5 minutes later I was pulling over in
										Washington MO getting a speeding ticket. My fault, thanks
										officer.
									</p>

									<p>
										I was going to be by myself all day Sunday, my buddy Chris
										wasn't able to make both days, and my buddy Chris from work
										had only planned on riding Saturday (which he bailed on due
										to family things). So I got setup early and ran into the
										Huebbe's, another pair of old racing buddies. I knew I
										wasn't going to be keeping up with them as I had checked out
										there Strava times from Saturday, so I just said hello and
										chatted a bit before heading to the start line for loop
										number 4.
									</p>

									<p>
										Loop 4 started with 17 miles of Katy Trail, which honestly
										takes a lot out of you. I was in a line, sharing some of the
										work load, flying down at 15-17mph, by the time we reached
										the turn off of the Katy trail I had it in my head that I
										was simply going to turn around and ride the 17 miles back
										into town and call it a day. The Katy Trail is draining, it
										is packed lime stone, and simply gives you no ability to
										coast, you pedal or you stop,&nbsp; it is fairly flat, no
										hills whatsoever, and becomes mind numbing when you ride it
										for a length of time, especially on Day 2 of a weekend. I
										sat down at the trailhead where we were to exit the Katy and
										resolved to finish the loop, no turning back now, I was
										going to ride whatever was ahead of me, I needed to, I need
										the training for Dirty Kanza.
									</p>

									<p>
										The rest of Day 2 was fairly uneventful, some climbing, some
										descending, lots of gravel. The original Loop 4 was supposed
										to be right around 50 miles, but at the start of the ride
										they informed us that there would be a detour due to
										flooding on Highway 94, so we ended up cutting out about 5
										miles of route, and fortunately for me, one big climb in the
										process. After loop number 4 I was ready for a quick soda,
										and then packed up my things so I could head back home to
										try to spend some time with the family for at least a few
										hours of the weekend!
									</p>

									<p>
										With the Tour of Hermann Gravel challenge, you get a mason
										jar, and scoops of gravel for each of the loops that you
										complete. Because I had thought on Saturday afternoon that I
										was done, I grabbed my jar and my two scoops before heading
										home. I ended up leaving the jar at home, so I wasn't able
										to get my third scoop of gravel for Day 2, but I was happy
										with my results nonetheless. The #TOHGRAVEL told me that I
										had a lot more training to do before Dirty Kanza. I was told
										by a previous DK rider that the Tour of Hermann was tougher
										than Dirty Kanza, and while I didn't do the full TOH I sure
										hope that it was tougher than DK so that come June 1st I am
										more prepared than I think I am!
