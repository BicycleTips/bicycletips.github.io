											Wow, what a weekend. The 2019 running of the Dirty Kanza
											has come and gone, and all I can think about is doing it
											again, not next year, but next weekend! I can’t wait for
											the opportunity to enter and hopefully try the event in
											2020. I’ll give a rundown of the weekend’s activities.
										</p>

										<p>
											<img

										</p>

										<p>
											The characters: The writer, Chris H., owner of
											BicycleTips.com. The strong guy, Steve W., fellow Crossfit
											Wildwood teammate for Dirty Kanza. The funny one, Chris L.
											former Autocrosser and full-time funny guy. Dad, Bill H.,
											the SAG guy.
										</p>

										<p>
											We (Chris H, Steve, and Bill) left St. Louis (Wildwood)
											around 7 am on Friday morning, and headed west. The trip
											was decent, riding most of the way west on I-70 and then
											heading south around Kansas City on to I-35. It wasn’t
											until we were within 15 miles of Emporia before we saw our
											first sign of other riders heading into town. We pulled
											into town and came across a Floyd’s Of Leadville sprinter.
										</p>

										<p>

												alt="Floyd's Of Leadville"
											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											From the gas station, we headed towards Mechanic St to
											find the Expo, and parking. We lucked out in a lot that
											had a parking space just 30 feet from some of the booths
											set up for the expo. We hit a couple of booths and started
											looking for food as we had been on the road for 5 hours
											without stopping for a meal.
										</p>

										<p>
											We came across a small food truck area, with a couple of
											different options available. I went with the safe to
											choose pulled pork sandwich and hounded it down so that I
											could free my hands. We decided that before heading
											through the expo, which looked kickass, we would head over
											to the Rider Sign In area at the Lyon County History
											Center on Commercial St.
										</p>

										<p>
											<img

												alt="Rider Sign In Dirty Kanza 2019"
											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											At the rider sign-in, we picked up our T-Shirts that we
											got for registering, and then had the opportunity to make
											a pass down the “swag” table, from which we were given
											Dirty Kanza socks, a head sock, a branded DK 2019 Camelbak
											bottle, and various other bits of gear and items from some
											of the sponsors of the event. While picking up gear I had
											the pleasure of meeting Jim Cummins’ wife Susie. After the
											swag table, we picked up our parking sticker for our SAG
											vehicle, with two riders and one SAG vehicle we picked up
											one decal before heading back downstairs to find our SAG
											driver (my Father Bill).
										</p>

										<p>
											After finishing at the rider sign-in area we headed down
											to wander around the Expo that had overtaken a few blocks
											of downtown Emporia. I can’t even begin to describe all
											the cool things you missed out on if you didn’t attend the
											Expo. There were bike manufacturers, tire manufacturers,
											seat manufacturers, parts and tools vendors, clothing
											organizations, training plans, electronic training folks,
											CBD vendors, supplements, nutrition planners, and many
											many more.
										</p>

										<p>
											I walked around and talked to more vendors than I have at
											any previous conference or expo I’ve attended, and I’ve
											attended quite a few with my day job in the fitness and
											tech industries. I picked up lots of swag for my kids, and
											items that I thought I could either use on the ride, or at
											some point in the future.
										</p>

										<p>
											One item that stuck out in the expo area was the Chaise
											lounge from Salsa Cycles, for more info on that visit
											www.chasethechaise.com and see another photo of it later
											in this post.
										</p>

												alt="The Chaise before the Chase"
											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											After partaking in the expo we got a message from Chris L.
											that he had arrived and was making his way over to the
											Expo. We decided that we should figure out when we could
											get a ride in, but before that, we wanted to watch the
											start of the DKXL, the 350-mile race that started at 3 pm
											on Friday.
										</p>

										<p>
											<img
												src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47997791391_37ccd163d2_c.jpg"
												alt="DKXL Starting Line"
											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											After watching the start, we decided that we would head to
											the 4 pm rider’s meeting, and then after that meeting head
											out for a 10-12 mile bike ride to get our legs turning and
											check out the starting 5 miles of the course.
										</p>

										<p>
											The rider’s meeting started off with a DK Productions
											video and then Jim Cummins stood on stage and gave
											everyone an overview of the pertinent event details.
											Basics, 200-mile ride started at 6 am, 100-mile ride at
											6:30 am, with cutoff times equating to a 10mph average
											to/out of a checkpoint. For the 100-mile ride we had to
											make it to the 54-mile checkpoint by 12 pm, and leave by
											12:30 pm, other than that the only time we had to worry
											about was the 3 am time that the finish line would be shut
											down so they could open up the streets again.
										</p>

										<p>
											After the meeting, we headed back out onto the street to
											get to our bikes to get ready for our ride. Before riding
											however I had to make a stop into Mulready’s to see if I
											could fulfill one of my three goals for the Dirty Kanza,
											getting a selfie with pro-rider and 2017 DK 200 winner,
											Alison Tetrick. I was unsuccessful in finding her, but I
											did find her mustached likeness.
										</p>

										</p>

										<p>
											Dad took the Tahoe to the hotel to get checked in. We
											planned to ride about 5 miles into the course that we
											would be riding on Saturday and then turn back to town,
											and then on to the hotel. The ride out of town consisted
											of around 1.5 miles of paved roadway before veering off
											state highway 99 and on to the infamous gravel.
										</p>

										<p>

												src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47997752888_5ffee1017f_c.jpg"
												alt="Kansas Gravel"
											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											This quick ride was amazing, at around 5 miles we crossed
											over a bridge spanning the turnpike and stopped to enjoy
											the view. We spotted a group of riders down the hill that
											had a vehicle following them, and a photographer. We
											figured out they must be some kind of a ruckus if they’ve
											got photogs following them around on a Friday evening
											ride. They headed up the hill towards us, stopped and said
											hello, before we all headed back towards town. The group
											consisted of some of the Pro riders from the Education
											First team, with whom we enjoyed a casual ride back into
											town, before dropping them in our dust as we rolled onto
											the pavement. (In reality, I believe they stopped to take
											more photos, but we didn’t look back to check).
										</p>

												alt="Stretching the legs on Friday"
											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											Heading back to the hotel was overall uneventful, though
											Steve managed to hit a bump and lost his tail light, we
											stopped to head back and grab it off the road, but before
											we could a pickup truck ran it over. Luckily I had brought
											a spare, so I gave him that to meet the requirement of
											having a front/rear light.
										</p>

										<p>
											The morning of the event we got up before 5 am with the
											intention of leaving the hotel by 5 to get downtown. We
											managed to get a last-minute room at the Super 8, so we
											were in town and not too far away. Originally we couldn’t
											get a local hotel and booked in Topeka, that would have
											made for a REALLY early morning having to drive over an
											hour to get there.
										</p>

										<p>
											We got onsite early, found a good parking spot, the very
											same spot we parked in the day before, and started getting
											our bikes and our gear ready for the ride. We headed on
											over to the starting line around 5:30 to check out the
											DK200 riders lining up and to try to find a friend from
											Ohio who was going to be starting. Walking along the
											sidewalk I nearly bumped into him without even noticing
											until he said hello. We wished him good luck and wandered
											up to the front of the line to see what the lineup looked
											like. They had the “12 hour” line, and then in front of
											that, they were introducing the pros and past winners.
										</p>

										<p>

												alt="Dirty Kanza 200 Start Line"
											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											For the Dirty Kanza 100 ride, we had a posted start time
											of 6:30 am, after the 200rs rode out we headed off to grab
											out bikes and finish our prep. We lined up towards the
											back of the pack, not wanting to try to get out in the
											crush at the front. The reasoning behind this was twofold:
											one, we didn’t want to deal with the chaos of the mass of
											people at the front, two, we didn’t want to be at the
											front and worry about burning ourselves out in the first
											hour of the ride. When 6:30 rolled around and we started,
											it was a slow roll across the start line for us, it took
											us well over two minutes to get across the start line.
										</p>

										<p>
											The weather was perfect, the sun was up, it was probably
											in the 60s with a slight haze, with gravel dust adding to
											that. The ride out of town was lined with people from the
											community watching and cheering riders on, it was very
											motivational to see so much community support. Very early
											on we started seeing water bottles littering the route,
											and people off on the side of the road for flat tires. We
											must have passed over 100 bottles on the ground on
											Saturday and I don’t know how many flat tires.
										</p>

										<p>
											The first 25 miles or so of the ride were excellent, the
											surface was great, the pace was good, not pushing too
											hard, but not going too slow either. As we were still
											heading north the road switched from maintained gravel to
											double track farm road that quickly got rutted.
											Fortunately, the weather was beautiful for the few days
											before DK, otherwise, this particular section of the road
											would have been a mud fest. Around Mile 30 we changed our
											direction, heading west/southwest towards the town of
											Council Grove, the only SAG checkpoint, at mile 54, for
											the DK 100 route.
										</p>

										<p>

											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											By the time we were heading west, Chris and Steve had both
											gone up ahead. I could have pushed to try to stay with
											them, but I wanted to take the day steady and not risk
											burning myself out. They stopped and waited for me a few
											times, but I had told them previously to feel free to ride
											on without me. They both reached the halfway checkpoint
											ahead of me, I found Steve and my Dad cheering me on as I
											came off the trail into the parking lot at the high
											school.
										</p>

										<p>
											I had prepped PB&amp;J sandwiches for my meal at the
											checkpoint, so I grabbed one and an orange/vanilla coke,
											and a folding chair and plopped down in the shade for a
											rest. Before getting into my food I took off my shoes and
											socks to try to let my feet dry a bit. There was one water
											crossing (the whole day) and while I made an attempt at
											riding it, I only made it about halfway before hopping off
											the bike and soaking both feet in the cool stream. It felt
											great, but gave me a nice sloshy shoe for the next few
											miles.
										</p>

												alt="DK100 Checkpoint"
											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											When I arrived at the checkpoint I figured out I had
											missed something, my GoPro sitting on the front of the
											bike was dusty as hell, so I realized that the
											photos/video from the morning were going to have a haze to
											them, after that point I realized I needed to wipe the
											camera occasionally and did so for the rest of the day.
											Time flew by quick in the checkpoint, I ended up spending
											an hour there, way more than I had planned, but I wanted
											to take my time and rest. Before departing I restocked my
											water supplies, food, and applied some sunscreen,
											recharged the GoPro Hero Session, and removed my GoPro
											Hero 5 Black from my bag, leaving it in the Tahoe.
										</p>

										<p>
											For some reason, I didn’t use my spray-on sunscreen and
											went with a cream that I carried in my backpack. This
											particular brand happens to be extra thick, so I figured
											it would help keep me from getting burned. Shortly later
											out on the course, however, I noticed my arms were
											extremely red, so I began thinking that I was burning
											badly, and going to be in pain later that night.
											Fortunately for me, I think I just had a reaction to the
											sunscreen itself, while I was red all day, once I removed
											the sunscreen I was not burned, lucky me as it was sunny
											all day, no clouds, and hot.
										</p>

										<p>
											Before leaving the checkpoint Steve and I took the
											opportunity to use the restroom and reapply some Chamois
											Butter. While clipping into my bike after this, I managed
											to fall over. I reached out for a guy standing near me,
											but was unable to get my balance and took a dive on my
											right knee. I scraped it up, but nothing too major. If
											anything this event gave me a shot of adrenaline, so we
											headed off.
										</p>

										<p>
											The route after the checkpoint started off with a climb up
											a paved road, heading south out of Council Grove, before
											veering off to the west again onto gravel. To start off
											the second half of the ride Steve and I planned to stay
											together. He actually started having a leg cramp before
											the checkpoint, and had been trying to work it out during
											our rest. Unable to do so, he was limited in his ability
											to push up the hills for the afternoon. He told me to ride
											on, but I decided that I would simply take the opportunity
											to slow my pace down and ride the hills and wait for him
											where necessary. This worked out well for me, it allowed
											me to ride and rest, without pushing myself overly hard
											and prevented burnout.
										</p>

										<p>
											After the checkpoint, we started to come across some DKXL
											(350 mile) riders who were heading north. I believe the
											first one we passed was Malinda Gillespie, pictured below.
											I’m guessing this would have been around mile 220-230 for
											Malinda at this point, and possibly between 70-75 miles
											for us for the day.
										</p>

										</p>

										<p>
											The afternoon ride contains a few larger hills, more so
											than we found on the morning route, with quite a few
											rollers as well. It was also starting to get hot, very
											hot. I was concerned with dehydration, so I forced myself
											to drink. We came across a farm at one point that had a
											sign on the road that they had water, so I headed off to
											check that out and found they had a spigot ready for us to
											fill up. I was carrying two 24oz Camelbak bottles and a 3L
											bladder in my backpack. I quickly downed one of the 24oz
											bottles and refilled it from the farm water. I went
											through that bottle and refilled it again before leaving,
											Steve took off ahead of me, but I was able to get back to
											him in short order. Later in the day, I felt I had
											actually consumed too much water at some point, and
											started feeling it. Fortunately, I never got sick, and
											other than that slight discomfort I was fine.
										</p>

										<p>
											The longer the ride went on, the more the heat started to
											come into play. At the water stop, I pulled out a bandana
											and put it on my head under my helmet. I believe I
											intended to douse it in water before putting it on my
											head, but I failed to do that, so the next time I stopped
											to wait for Steve I took the opportunity to take it off. I
											wasn’t sweating so much that I was having to worry about
											sweat in my eyes, but I did put the bandana in a side
											pocket of my backpack that I could reach while riding and
											used it a few times to wipe my face off.
										</p>

										<p>
											At one point I came up to a hidden Y-Intersection and went
											right, not realizing that was the wrong direction.
											Fortunately, my Garmin Edge 520 quickly notified me I was
											off course, to which I was SURE it was wrong. I pulled up
											the map view on the Garmin, and sure enough, I was off
											course, so I turned around and went back to the proper
											course, and waited for Steve. His cell phone, which he had
											been using for Navigation, had overheated from being in
											the sun, and charging off a battery, so it was out of
											commission and I wanted to make sure he didn’t miss the
											turn.
										</p>

										<p>
											We found out later from Chris L. that he and 2 other
											riders made the same incorrect turn and ended up adding
											about 6 miles overall to their ride going that wrong
											direction. They didn’t end up backtracking, but found
											their way back to the course later on, missing some of the
											larger hills that we had to climb.
										</p>

										<p>
											On one of those climbs, while waiting for Steve to get up
											the hill I took the opportunity to perch my Niner RLT up
											against a fence for a quick photoshoot.
										</p>

										<p>

											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											After the shoot, I looked down and saw a guy flying up the
											hill that many folks were walking and thought, oh boy,
											here comes the Dirty Kanza 200 leader! I was right, and up
											came Colin Strickland. There were 5 or 6 of us at the top
											of the hill all cheering him on as he tore down the
											decline. It wasn’t long after that another 200-mile rider
											flew by us going down the hill trying to catch up to
											Strickland. After that point, we realized we now had to be
											a lot more cautious as to how much road we took up going
											up and down the hills, we didn’t want to get into anyone’s
											way, so we tried to pay attention to who was coming up
											from behind.
										</p>

										<p>
											At one point Steve yelled up to me, I thought telling me
											that a car was coming, I reached my hand out to make the
											motion that I was looking to hitch a ride. In doing so I
											about punched the two riders from the Education First
											team, I’m hoping they didn’t realize and thought I was
											simply giving them thumbs up as they flew by, and fly by
											they did. It was amazing how much faster these leaders
											were moving versus the average joes that were still out
											doing the 100-mile ride.
										</p>

										<p>
											As the DK200 guys got closer to us, traffic started to
											pick up, mostly due to various photographers in chase
											vehicles trying to get into position to catch the best
											shot they could. Here’s a photo of one of the keeps
											passing me, photographer sticking out of the top.
										</p>

										</p>

										<p>
											We passed by a lake with some pontoon boats on it, they
											all cheered and yelled Let’s Go Blues after they asked us
											where we were from. After the lake was a large hill, at
											least for Kansas. I rode up the beginning of the hill,
											walked the middle, and rode the topmost portion. At the
											top was a lovely group of people passing out water and
											PB&amp;J sandwiches. I didn’t take a sandwich but I gladly
											took their ice-cold water.
										</p>

										<p>
											One of the other amazing things about Dirty Kanza was the
											people. The organizers, the volunteers, the town, the
											people along the route. There were thousands of people out
											there. Cheering people on, passing out water, waving,
											honking, clapping, ringing cowbells, it was great to see
											the way everyone gets involved in the event, and these
											weren’t just people in Emporia, it was everywhere along
											the 100-mile route.
										</p>

										<p>
											One other stop on the ride was the previously mentioned
											Chaise. Salsa Cycles takes the chair around to various
											gravel events and has people stop and take photos on the
											chair, in exchange for a copy of the photo (online) and a
											patch. Steve and I came across the Chaise at the bottom of
											a hill and had to stop for a photo. Due to his cramping,
											he decided not to sit down, I figured I would take that
											opportunity to take up the whole couch and do my “sexy”
											pose, here you go…
										</p>

										</p>

										<p>
											I’ve found that between mile 90-95 on a long ride,
											sometimes earlier, you really start to get depressed.
											You’re not quite at the end, and your motivation is
											lacking. You start to really tire, get hot, and think
											you’ll never finish the ride. It hurts to pedal on, you
											struggle to keep the motivation up. I experienced this on
											the DK100, our slow pace, and the heat, made me simply
											want to stop. Stopping wasn’t an option, I wasn’t about to
											call my dad and have him come get us, but the urge was
											there. About this time Chris L. caught up to us. He told
											us all about his off-course excursion. He and the two guys
											who had gotten lost with him were going at a little bit
											faster pace and headed up the road. At one point he asked
											me if I was signing up for next year, I told him to ask me
											tomorrow as my answer at that point in time was a
											resounding no.
										</p>

										<p>
											About 5 miles from the finish though we found a new gear,
											picked up the pace, and caught the three guys, bringing
											Chris along with us we took off towards the finish. The
											route back to the finish took us through Emporia State
											University with a climb or two added in there for good
											measure, just to make sure your legs hurt.
										</p>

										<p>
											Steve and I crossed the finish line together, I believe my
											official time was 11:07:00 and his profile shows 11:07:01,
											but we were pretty much side by side. At the finish, we
											were greeted by volunteers who gave us a cold towel, our
											finishing badge, and a handshake from Jim Cummins, DK
											Co-Founder. We received branded Half-Pint glasses, and
											some GU recovery drink before heading off for our
											finisher’s photo. From there we found a place to sit down
											and sat for a good 30 minutes, fondly talking about our
											adventures that day. We compared our data, the distance
											traveled, the time it took, and the elevation. My Strava
											route showed 4400’ of elevation, Steve’s showed more,
											Chris’ showed 4900’.
										</p>

										<p>
											My legs were the dirtiest part of my body, I expected my
											face to be covered as well, but I must have kept wiping my
											face with the bandana enough to keep it fairly clean. Over
											all I felt great, my body didn’t hurt, I could tell the
											nerves in my left hand were an issue, something I had
											experienced after the Tour Of Hermann Gravel Challenge
											earlier in the year.
										</p>

										<p>

												alt="My beautiful legs after DK 100"
											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											After attempting to recover for a while, we decided we
											should get up, change, and put our bikes away. We found a
											free bike wash and had the bikes sprayed off before
											putting them back on the rack on the Tahoe. I threw on a
											clean change of clothing, and wiped down with a wet rag to
											make myself look at least somewhat presentable before
											heading back over towards the finish line.
										</p>

										<p>
											When we got back over to the finish line I hit the Gravel
											City store to pick up some souvenirs for a friend and my
											wife. When we walked out, I saw Alison Tetrick in the
											finishing chute. She must have finished sometime while we
											were at the Tahoe. She was being directed over to the
											Finisher’s photo area, so I ran over and quickly asked her
											if she wouldn’t mind taking a selfie with me. I tried to
											line the camera up for the shot, but she grabbed my phone
											and told me her angles are better than mine, so she would
											shoot it. Before shooting it she got her first look at her
											finisher’s face, and found a pretty awesome dirt unibrow,
											to which she exclaimed “Ooh, I have a unibrow, I’m so
											rocking this”. She finished second at this year’s event.
										</p>

										</p>

										<p>
											Saturday evening we hung around the finish area, and
											headed to the Mexican restaurant to grab some food. The
											atmosphere in the restaurant was amazing, competitors,
											fans, family, locals, all hanging out having a good time
											and good food. Afterwards we watched the last of the “Race
											the Sun” competitors, those 200-mile entrants trying to
											get in before sundown. One finisher beat the 8:45 pm time
											by milliseconds to qualify. We didn’t stay the whole
											night, the finish line was up and running until 3 am, as
											competitors from the 100, 200, and 350 were finishing
											until early in the morning on Sunday.
										</p>

										<p>
											My recovery since DK has been great. We drove back to St.
											Louis on Sunday morning, leaving Emporia around 7:30 am. I
											was worried that I would be sore sitting in the car for 5
											hours, but we made the trip without a problem and I’ve yet
											to experience any real pain or discomfort since. The only
											problem I have is my left hand has some carpal tunnel-like
											symptoms, numbness, and lack of grip strength. I’m hopeful
											that this goes away in a few days, it even provides me
											with an odd feeling when typing, which in my profession is
											unfortunate, but hopefully only temporary.
										</p>

										<p>
											My Final Thoughts on the Dirty Kanza event. MUST DO IT
											AGAIN NEXT YEAR! I had so much fun at this event. I had
											three goals for the weekend.
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Complete the Dirty Kanza 100</li>
											<li>Spend quality time in the state of my birth</li>
											<li>Get a selfie with Alison Tetrick</li>
										</ol>

										<p>
											I am proud to say I completed all three of those goals!
										</p>

										<p>
											We had a great time out in Emporia, Kansas for the 2019
											Dirty Kanza. I personally look forward to doing this event
											every year I can get the opportunity to do so. We had
											great weather, great friends, and no mechanical issues!
											Between the three of us, we didn’t have a single flat. I
											don’t know if we should attribute that to Luck, being
											Slow, or being Talented enough to avoid the sharp stuff.
											Maybe a little bit of all three of those.
										</p>

										<p>
											Later this week I’ll have another article up covering any
											changes I made to gear selection, our previous post had
											links to all the gear we planned to bring, and I want to
											basically update you on what we took, needed, and didn’t
											need.
