										Monday morning I texted my buddy Wagner (Wags) to tell him I
										was out, I would not be going to Bentonville for Big Sugar
										Gravel. I had spent a few days fighting a sinus infection (I
										am vaccinated and tested negative for covid, though I was
										pretty sure before the test that it was a usual for me sinus
										thing). I had only been on my bike once in October, and was
										simply not ready to try to ride 100 miles in North West
										Arkansas and South West Missouri.
									</p>

									<p>
										He let me stew on the message I sent him for a bit then
										suggested we could still do the 50 mile ride, the Little
										Sugar. By early afternoon that simple reply from him had
										flipped my mindset. We went out for a ride that afternoon
										and I was back in the game, though with an adjusted plan to
										ride 50 miles and still be back home in St. Louis Saturday
										night so I could go to my daughter’s gymnastics competition
										on Sunday.
									</p>

									<p>
										Friday morning we left St. Louis County arriving in
										Bentonville shortly after 1pm. We went to the 8th Street
										Market to figure out where Outerbike was, and to grab some
										lunch before registration was supposed to open. At
										registration we were easily able to switch our entries from
										Big Sugar to Little Sugar, and I got a thank you from Treva
										for letting them know about a bridge that was out on the 100
										mile route.
									</p>

										<em>Side Note:</em> So this trip was not my first to
										Bentonville, I had actually been down there for the first
										time one week prior, meeting with a potential customer about
										a software project. On my drive back, last Friday the 15th,
										I decided to cruise along some of the gravel roads to see
										what we were in for. I wasn’t more than a mile off the
										highway when I came across a closed road, which I knew from
										looking at the Ride With GPS map was part of the route for
										Big Sugar. I drove down the closed road (don’t try this at
										home kids) and came across a crew working feverishly on a
										bridge. Before I got home on Friday I reached out to the
										LifeTime crew to ask if they knew about the bridge. They
										reached out on Monday and made sure to get out and check it
										out. In their defense, they had recently covered the course,
										but the bridge was damaged sometime after that scouting run.

									<p>
										From there we walked around Outerbike. I must admit, the
										Dirty Kanza/Unbound Gravel expo puts all other expos at
										events (besides my one trip to Sea Otter) to shame. I was
										kind of expecting Outerbike to compete, but it was much
										smaller. It was most definitely there for the MTB crew, and
										while the Gravel folks were accepted, the focus was on
										mountain bikes and demos, primarily. That being said, we
										picked up a number of swag items, including waffles from
										both Untapped and Honeystinger.
									</p>

									<p>
										Wags found and geeked out with Jom from
										<a
											href="https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/big-sugar-gravel-race-day-results-highlights-photos/"
											>GravelCyclist</a
										>.
									</p>

									<p>
										Another local, Adelmann, from St. Louis showed up at the
										expo, so we organized a brief afternoon ride. He wanted to
										check out the beginning of the course, and I was really more
										interested in trying to see some of Bentonville and some of
										the trails. Wags and I ended up heading up towards the
										Slaughter Pen trail, which also happened to be the finish
										area for both Big and Little Sugar. We headed off into some
										single track on our gravel steeds and had a blast trying not
										to injure ourselves before Saturday. From there we headed
										out the road up and under the highway. We ended up only
										putting in about 10.5 miles, but it was enough to get our
										legs moving a bit and see some of Bentonville.
									</p>

									<p>
										We stopped at the Phat Bike shop and eached picked up a
										t-shirt, while I picked up some new cleats for my shoes
										thinking that my old ones were wearing out (they weren’t,
										the new ones felt just as loose as the old ones).

										Saturday morning we checked out of the hotel and headed up
										to find a parking spot. We ended up parking near the Square
										in Bentonville, which worked out fricken amazingly. There
										was a public bathroom right there, and we were 1 block from
										the finish line so that after the ride we could easily get
										the bikes back on the rack and we could change clothes. We
										had hoped to make it to the start line for the 7am Big Sugar
										start, to see Adelmann off, but ended up not making it down
										there until closer to 720am.

										The start was at the Momentary, which to be honest, is a
										cool looking building, but I have no idea what it actually
										is, the assumption is it is some sort of art space. (Runs
										off to google: The Momentary brings together contemporary
										visual, performing, and culinary arts into a welcoming,
										communal space in Northwest Arkansas.)

										The Little Sugar ride went off right as scheduled at 8am
										with a lead out of town, we were back far enough that we
										couldn’t see the lead, but I believe it was local police
										doing the work on that. Before too long we were on Gravel
										and off into the beautiful country known as North West
										Arkansas (and southwest Missouri).

										There was a threat of rain, but that didn’t materialize. We
										did get a pretty scary looking storm at the rest stop, to
										the north of there it was dark and the wind started blowing
										pretty good for a bit, but for use on the Little Sugar
										course we remained dry with only a couple of seconds of
										spitting drops here or there.

										The course itself was amazing, hilly but the hills were not
										TOO much. I did get off and walk on a couple of those hills
										however. I was able to hop back on and finish the climbs
										each time I did though. We made it to the the aid station at
										Whistling Springs Brewery without any noticeable trouble,
										though neither Wags nor I drank enough fluids in that first
										2 hours on the ride. I chugged a bottle of Scratch that I
										had to try to force fluids in me and then grabbed some water
										at the brewery to fill both bottles back up.
									</p>

									<p>
										The aid station was stocked with Untapped Maple products, as
										well as other assorted items. I tried their “MapleAid” which
										I pictured as lemonade, had someone told me it was Tea I
										might have taken to it better, but expecting lemonade with
										maple flavor, I quickly poored out the sample that I had put
										in my bottle and just grabbed water instead.
									</p>

									<p>
										Wags went inside and grabbed himself a beer, as we all had
										“drink” tickets that we could use there. I grabbed some
										snacks and looked around a bit. With the storm appearing to
										be moving our way, I wasn’t too intersted in standing
										around, but I did get to see some of the beautiful property
										there, including a pig and dog wandering around saying hello
										to people.
									</p>

									<p>
										To get out of the brewery you climb up Whistling Springs
										road, I was chugging along the climb when I decided to stand
										up and put a little effort into it. This caused my rear tire
										to lose traction, my foot to immediately fall down to the
										bottom of my stroke, a quick unclip and I was hoofing it for
										a little while up the hill.
									</p>

									<p>
										It was shortly after leaving the brewery that we came across
										a maroon Toyota Tacoma, first coming at us, then after it
										turned around, it passed us going back the way from which it
										came. Not a minute or two later and we came across the same
										Tacoma stopped in the middle of the road. He stopped because
										a rider had fallen on the downhill, we could see a rider
										down in front of the truck.
									</p>

									<p>
										I immedatiately jumped off my bike, called 911 and began
										trying to figure out where we actually were so that we could
										get help to us. For now, for the families sake, I will leave
										out any additional details, if anyone from the family would
										like more info, please feel free to
										<a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/contact">contact me</a
										>.
									</p>

									<p>
										Wags and I stayed on the scene for about 45 minutes, before
										heading back out on the road. On the way out the ambulance
										was coming in, we were glad to see that.

										The rest of the ride kind of blurs together, at one point
										Wags and I were talking about how we hadn’t had any of the
										100 mile competitors pass us since the accident (maybe 15
										came through while we were there, a BIG thank you to those
										who slowed down, to those of you who didn’t, a couple of the
										top 5 men’s riders, show some decency next time). We began
										to wonder if the organizers had closed the course at the
										Brewery for weather or something.
									</p>

									<p>
										It wasn’t until shortly after this conversation that we
										started to get riders coming by us from the 100, we found
										out later talking to a gentleman who finished in the 21st
										spot that they had actually shut the course down where the
										ambulance arrived on the scene.

										Once the trickle started as 100 mile riders were passing us,
										the flood came. Mostly we were passed by the top men, but a
										number of women passed by as well, including Amity Rockwell.
										A big shout out to all the riders who passed us slower guys
										with words of encouragement, it was much appreciated each
										and every time someone said something.
									</p>

									<p>
										The finish required you to climb back up into the park area
										around the start of Slaughter Pen, you were on paved roads
										at this point, but was a slog for someone who wasn’t in
										shape and ready for a 50 mile ride. Wags waited for me and
										helped motivate me towards the finish as we crossed the line
										together, 5 hours and 21 minutes after we started, in 254th
										and 255th spot. I definitely had hoped to finish this ride
										in under 5 hours, hoping for closer to 4 hours, but with
										over 3k feet of elevation, and stopping for 45 minutes to
										assist, I am please that we still finished in 5:21.
									</p>

									<p>
										Post ride you were given a mug/mason jar of Untapped Maple
										syrup and a big lollipop (lots of SUGAR). Wags and I headed
										back to the car, loaded up the bikes and changed into some
										street clothing to be comfortable before heading back to the
										finish area to grab food from a food truck with our meal
										tickets.
									</p>

									<p>
										We sat down and talked to a few fellow competitors, and I
										chatted with
										<a href="https://instagram.com/bigtallwayne"
											>Big Tall Wayne</a
										>
										again (Wags and I spoke to him Friday at the 8th street
										market, as well as at Unbound earlier this year). Adelmann
										wandered up to us after he finished and he downed a bottle
										of my Scratch Labs drink that I had made while at the truck.
										He was struggling with nutritional issues and said he was
										fortunate to have finished having vision concerns the last
										~30 miles of his ride. He averaged 14.98mph on his ride,
										while Wagner and I averaged 9.94mph.

										I got all sorts of comments on my jersey for the ride on
										Saturday. I wore my 2019 Cuban Gravel Crisis jersey. That
										WAS a real ride, and I gotta say, the best named gravel race
										in the history of gravel races. Unfortunately I hear rumors
										that the organizer of the ride no longer has rights to the
										name and is changing the name going forward, that’s
										unfortunate (looks like they let the domain expire even,
										that’s a shame)!
