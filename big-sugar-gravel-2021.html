											Monday morning I texted my buddy Wagner (Wags) to tell him
											I was out, I would not be going to Bentonville for Big
											Sugar Gravel. I had spent a few days fighting a sinus
											infection (I am vaccinated and tested negative for covid,
											though I was pretty sure before the test that it was a
											usual for me sinus thing). I had only been on my bike once
											in October, and was simply not ready to try to ride 100
											miles in North West Arkansas and South West Missouri.
										</p>

										<p>
											He let me stew on the message I sent him for a bit then
											suggested we could still do the 50 mile ride, the Little
											Sugar. By early afternoon that simple reply from him had
											flipped my mindset. We went out for a ride that afternoon
											and I was back in the game, though with an adjusted plan
											to ride 50 miles and still be back home in St. Louis
											Saturday night so I could go to my daughter’s gymnastics
											competition on Sunday.
										</p>

										<p>
											Friday morning we left St. Louis County arriving in
											Bentonville shortly after 1pm. We went to the 8th Street
											Market to figure out where Outerbike was, and to grab some
											lunch before registration was supposed to open. At
											registration we were easily able to switch our entries
											from Big Sugar to Little Sugar, and I got a thank you from
											Treva for letting them know about a bridge that was out on
											the 100 mile route.
										</p>

											<em>Side Note:</em> So this trip was not my first to
											Bentonville, I had actually been down there for the first
											time one week prior, meeting with a potential customer
											about a software project. On my drive back, last Friday
											the 15th, I decided to cruise along some of the gravel
											roads to see what we were in for. I wasn’t more than a
											mile off the highway when I came across a closed road,
											which I knew from looking at the Ride With GPS map was
											part of the route for Big Sugar. I drove down the closed
											road (don’t try this at home kids) and came across a crew
											working feverishly on a bridge. Before I got home on
											Friday I reached out to the LifeTime crew to ask if they
											knew about the bridge. They reached out on Monday and made
											sure to get out and check it out. In their defense, they
											had recently covered the course, but the bridge was
											damaged sometime after that scouting run.

											From there we walked around Outerbike. I must admit, the
											Dirty Kanza/Unbound Gravel expo puts all other expos at
											events (besides my one trip to Sea Otter) to shame. I was
											kind of expecting Outerbike to compete, but it was much
											smaller. It was most definitely there for the MTB crew,
											and while the Gravel folks were accepted, the focus was on
											mountain bikes and demos, primarily. That being said, we
											picked up a number of swag items, including waffles from
											both Untapped and Honeystinger.
										</p>

										<p>
											Wags found and geeked out with Jom from
											<a
												href="https://www.gravelcyclist.com/race-reports/big-sugar-gravel-race-day-results-highlights-photos/"
												>GravelCyclist</a
											>.
										</p>

										<p>
											Another local, Adelmann, from St. Louis showed up at the
											expo, so we organized a brief afternoon ride. He wanted to
											check out the beginning of the course, and I was really
											more interested in trying to see some of Bentonville and
											some of the trails. Wags and I ended up heading up towards
											the Slaughter Pen trail, which also happened to be the
											finish area for both Big and Little Sugar. We headed off
											into some single track on our gravel steeds and had a
											blast trying not to injure ourselves before Saturday. From
											there we headed out the road up and under the highway. We
											ended up only putting in about 10.5 miles, but it was
											enough to get our legs moving a bit and see some of
											Bentonville.
										</p>

										<p>
											We stopped at the Phat Bike shop and eached picked up a
											t-shirt, while I picked up some new cleats for my shoes
											thinking that my old ones were wearing out (they weren’t,
											the new ones felt just as loose as the old ones).

										<p>
											Saturday morning we checked out of the hotel and headed up
											to find a parking spot. We ended up parking near the
											Square in Bentonville, which worked out fricken amazingly.
											There was a public bathroom right there, and we were 1
											block from the finish line so that after the ride we could
											easily get the bikes back on the rack and we could change
											clothes. We had hoped to make it to the start line for the
											7am Big Sugar start, to see Adelmann off, but ended up not
											making it down there until closer to 720am.

										<p>
											The start was at the Momentary, which to be honest, is a
											cool looking building, but I have no idea what it actually
											is, the assumption is it is some sort of art space. (Runs
											off to google: The Momentary brings together contemporary
											visual, performing, and culinary arts into a welcoming,
											communal space in Northwest Arkansas.)

											The Little Sugar ride went off right as scheduled at 8am
											with a lead out of town, we were back far enough that we
											couldn’t see the lead, but I believe it was local police
											doing the work on that. Before too long we were on Gravel
											and off into the beautiful country known as North West
											Arkansas (and southwest Missouri).

											There was a threat of rain, but that didn’t materialize.
											We did get a pretty scary looking storm at the rest stop,
											to the north of there it was dark and the wind started
											blowing pretty good for a bit, but for use on the Little
											Sugar course we remained dry with only a couple of seconds
											of spitting drops here or there.

											The course itself was amazing, hilly but the hills were
											not TOO much. I did get off and walk on a couple of those
											hills however. I was able to hop back on and finish the
											climbs each time I did though. We made it to the the aid
											station at Whistling Springs Brewery without any
											noticeable trouble, though neither Wags nor I drank enough
											fluids in that first 2 hours on the ride. I chugged a
											bottle of Scratch that I had to try to force fluids in me
											and then grabbed some water at the brewery to fill both
											bottles back up.
										</p>

										<p>
											The aid station was stocked with Untapped Maple products,
											as well as other assorted items. I tried their “MapleAid”
											which I pictured as lemonade, had someone told me it was
											Tea I might have taken to it better, but expecting
											lemonade with maple flavor, I quickly poored out the
											sample that I had put in my bottle and just grabbed water
											instead.

										<p>
											Wags went inside and grabbed himself a beer, as we all had
											“drink” tickets that we could use there. I grabbed some
											snacks and looked around a bit. With the storm appearing
											to be moving our way, I wasn’t too intersted in standing
											around, but I did get to see some of the beautiful
											property there, including a pig and dog wandering around
											saying hello to people.
										</p>

										<p>
											To get out of the brewery you climb up Whistling Springs
											road, I was chugging along the climb when I decided to
											stand up and put a little effort into it. This caused my
											rear tire to lose traction, my foot to immediately fall
											down to the bottom of my stroke, a quick unclip and I was
											hoofing it for a little while up the hill.
										</p>

										<p>
											It was shortly after leaving the brewery that we came
											across a maroon Toyota Tacoma, first coming at us, then
											after it turned around, it passed us going back the way
											from which it came. Not a minute or two later and we came
											across the same Tacoma stopped in the middle of the road.
											He stopped because a rider had fallen on the downhill, we
											could see a rider down in front of the truck.
										</p>

										<p>
											I immedatiately jumped off my bike, called 911 and began
											trying to figure out where we actually were so that we
											could get help to us. For now, for the families sake, I
											will leave out any additional details, if anyone from the
											family would like more info, please feel free to
											<a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/contact"
												>contact me</a
											>.
										</p>

										<p>
											Wags and I stayed on the scene for about 45 minutes,
											before heading back out on the road. On the way out the
											ambulance was coming in, we were glad to see that.

											The rest of the ride kind of blurs together, at one point
											Wags and I were talking about how we hadn’t had any of the
											100 mile competitors pass us since the accident (maybe 15
											came through while we were there, a BIG thank you to those
											who slowed down, to those of you who didn’t, a couple of
											the top 5 men’s riders, show some decency next time). We
											began to wonder if the organizers had closed the course at
											the Brewery for weather or something.
										</p>

										<p>
											It wasn’t until shortly after this conversation that we
											started to get riders coming by us from the 100, we found
											out later talking to a gentleman who finished in the 21st
											spot that they had actually shut the course down where the
											ambulance arrived on the scene.

											Once the trickle started as 100 mile riders were passing
											us, the flood came. Mostly we were passed by the top men,
											but a number of women passed by as well, including Amity
											Rockwell. A big shout out to all the riders who passed us
											slower guys with words of encouragement, it was much
											appreciated each and every time someone said something.
										</p>

										<p>
											The finish required you to climb back up into the park
											area around the start of Slaughter Pen, you were on paved
											roads at this point, but was a slog for someone who wasn’t
											in shape and ready for a 50 mile ride. Wags waited for me
											and helped motivate me towards the finish as we crossed
											the line together, 5 hours and 21 minutes after we
											started, in 254th and 255th spot. I definitely had hoped
											to finish this ride in under 5 hours, hoping for closer to
											4 hours, but with over 3k feet of elevation, and stopping
											for 45 minutes to assist, I am please that we still
											finished in 5:21.
										</p>

										<p>
											Post ride you were given a mug/mason jar of Untapped Maple
											syrup and a big lollipop (lots of SUGAR). Wags and I
											headed back to the car, loaded up the bikes and changed
											into some street clothing to be comfortable before heading
											back to the finish area to grab food from a food truck
											with our meal tickets.
										</p>

										<p>
											We sat down and talked to a few fellow competitors, and I
											chatted with
											<a href="https://instagram.com/bigtallwayne"
												>Big Tall Wayne</a
											>
											again (Wags and I spoke to him Friday at the 8th street
											market, as well as at Unbound earlier this year). Adelmann
											wandered up to us after he finished and he downed a bottle
											of my Scratch Labs drink that I had made while at the
											truck. He was struggling with nutritional issues and said
											he was fortunate to have finished having vision concerns
											the last ~30 miles of his ride. He averaged 14.98mph on
											his ride, while Wagner and I averaged 9.94mph.

											I got all sorts of comments on my jersey for the ride on
											Saturday. I wore my 2019 Cuban Gravel Crisis jersey. That
											WAS a real ride, and I gotta say, the best named gravel
											race in the history of gravel races. Unfortunately I hear
											rumors that the organizer of the ride no longer has rights
											to the name and is changing the name going forward, that’s
											unfortunate (looks like they let the domain expire even,
											that’s a shame)!
