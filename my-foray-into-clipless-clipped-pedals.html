										First things first, I had no idea why they are called
										clipless pedals, and I still doubt the reasoning I read. I
										am actually going to call them CLIP pedals, because that is
										what they really are. More on that later.

									<p>
										So, I went to a pedal other than a standard platform, and
										boy am I glad I did! A couple of weeks ago I ordered a pair
										of shoes with the intention of getting some pedals to go
										along with them, Friday the pedals arrived. Saturday the
										wife and I (and baby) went to the pumpkin festival here in
										Half Moon Bay, taking the baby and trailer for the two mile
										drive to avoid sitting in traffic for which likely would
										have taken 30+ minutes. I didn&rsquo;t want to try the new
										pedals for this trip, so I waited until Sunday to install
										the pedals.

										Installation of the pedals was easy, everyone says you need
										to use a pedal wrench, but I managed just fine with a 17mm
										Craftsmen wrench from my toolbox, just as I did when I
										travelled with the bike a few weeks ago and boxed it up for
										the airplane.
									</p>

									<p>
										Once I installed the pedals fully loosened the clips on the
										pedals so that exit from the clips would be very easy, I
										have had plenty of people tell me that clipped pedals will
										be a new experience and I will likely fall. I figured having
										things as loose as possible would help to minimize that
										risk.
									</p>

									<p>
										I tested the process out a bit, without actually wearing the
										shoe. I made sure I understand how the shoe went in, and how
										it came out of the clips. Going in is fairly straight
										forward, and as I began riding it became very easy to do.
										Put the front in first, then push down. Getting out of the
										clipped pedals was just about as simple, just turn your foot
										left or right and you&rsquo;ll come free.
									</p>

									<p>
										I immediately put my shoes on and started riding around in a
										circle in our front yard (grassy) to test things out and see
										if I could manage to get in and out without trouble, all was
										well. From there I got changed, put on my bicycle shorts (<a
											href="http://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/13"
											>sans underwear</a
										>) and headed out for a ride. I took off down Highway 1
										early afternoon on Sunday, traffic was a bit busy from folks
										trying to get out of town after the pumpkin festival, that
										actually made for easy riding, the cars weren&rsquo;t moving
										as fast as usual down one. Leaving the neighborhood I came
										to my first stop sign, in and out of the pedals without any
										issue.
									</p>

									<p>
										After heading about 6 miles up 1 I turned off at the Moss
										Beach Distillery and decided to head up into the trails
										around Pillar Point, climbing a fairly steep asphalt
										incline, and then lots of dirt, all without trouble in the
										pedals.
									</p>

									<p>
										So why would anyone want to use clipped pedals on a bicycle?
										Holy cow! They make a huge difference. The best thing I
										heard before using them was &quot;instead of just pushing,
										your legs now push and pull&quot; until I heard that I
										couldn&rsquo;t figure out why people used them. That makes a
										huge difference, instead of your legs just pushing down on
										the pedals, they can now pull up.
									</p>

									<p>
										Sitting at a stop light or stop sign, I typically take one
										foot out of its clip, leaving the other in place. With the
										that foot clipped in, I can easily reposition the pedal for
										prime launch, rather than having to stick my toe under the
										pedal and try to flip it backwards into the right location.
										But that isn&rsquo;t the only pulling, and to be honest,
										that is really just a convenience.
									</p>

									<p>
										The real benefit comes into play when you are really getting
										into a ride, you get both legs working, not just on the
										downward stroke as with a standard pedal, but now going the
										complete revolution you can work the legs. I definitely felt
										that difference when I was riding, and I am still feeling it
										today, but it is a good sore! I look forward to riding again
										later this week so I can feel it again.
									</p>

									<p>
										So, back to the &quot;clipless&quot; thing. Well apparently
										&quot;clipless&quot; pedals refer to the fact that these
										types of pedals don&rsquo;t contain a strap or basket for
										your foot to go into. They do &quot;clip&quot; in place on
										the pedals, so I say screw it, I&rsquo;m going to call them
										clipped pedals, I think you should to.
									</p>

									<p>
										Have you tried clipped pedals yet? Do you ride without them?
