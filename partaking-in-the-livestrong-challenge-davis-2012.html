									</p>

									<p>
										First things first. A <strong>HUGE HUGE HUGE</strong> thank
										you to every one of the individuals and companies that
										sponsored our fundraising for the event. Without your help
										Team ITM America wouldn&rsquo;t have raised $4,300 in total
										for LIVESTRONG. Also a big thank you for the largest
										donation from
										<a href="http://www.itm-america.com">www.itm-america.com</a
										>, they really helped us out with their donation and the
										KITs they outfitted us in!
									</p>

									<p>
										And now for the details. All the build up, all the riding,
										all the fund raising, and here we are, three days past the
										event. I am not sore. Natalie is not sore. Did we really
										just ride 100 miles? Well no, actually, we didn&rsquo;t, we
										rode 95.8 miles, you can see the
										<a
											href="https://www.strava.com/activities/11667977?utm_content=194984&amp;utm_medium=referral"
											target="_blank"
											>results on Strava right here</a
										>.
									</p>

									<p>
										Unfortunately the ride wasn&rsquo;t a full 100 miles, but
										that was the design and layout of the course.
									</p>

									<p>
										Saturday morning Natalie and I said good-bye to baby
										Jacqueline, leaving her with Natalie&rsquo;s parents to
										watch her for the weekend. We drove up to Davis so we could
										get registered for the event, and then checked in to our
										hotel to relax a bit before we went to the fundraising
										dinner on Saturday night.
									</p>

									<p>
										Registration was pretty low key, we picked up all the
										&ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that we got, Natalie getting a t-shirt
										and water bottle, myself getting those items, plus a hat,
										bag, and LIVESTRONG jersey. Those items, along with two
										tickets to the fundraising dinner on Saturday night were my
										rewards for raising <strong>$4,015 </strong>for the event.
									</p>

									<p>
										We took a few moments to hang a few things on the dedication
										wall at the LIVESTRONG tent.
									</p>

										/></a>
									</p>

									<p>
										We checked out a few of the sponsor booths, picked up our
										Oakley Gift Cards, I got a cool Movember pin from the guys
										from <a href="http://www.movember.com">www.movember.com</a>,
										and then we headed off to find our hotel.
									</p>

									<p>
										We checked in to the Days Inn in Davis, CA on Saturday
										afternoon, and I tell you what we were in for an experience
										there. If you want to know all about it, go look it up on
										Yelp, I left a (not)nice review there. Here, I will just
										say, don&rsquo;t ever stay at the Days Inn in Davis
										California, it isn&rsquo;t worth your money.
									</p>

									<p>
										The dinner on Saturday night was great, while I actually
										didn&rsquo;t care for the food (I&rsquo;m a picky bastard so
										keep that in mind) Natalie enjoyed the meal. We had a great
										time talking to people throughout the evening. I think I
										enjoyed most hearing from the Texas 4000 riders, check them
										out at
										<a href="http://www.texas4000.org">www.texas4000.org</a>.
										They are heading from Austin to Anchorage, on their summer
										break! LIVESTRONG also had a guest speaker,
										<a
											href="http://blog.livestrong.org/2010/04/23/amy-dodson-one-leg-one-lung-100-miles/"
											target="_blank"
											>Amy Dodson</a
										>, her story was amazing to hear and nearly brought me to
										tears right there at the dinner table.
									</p>

									<p>
										After dinner we went back to the hotel to do some final
										preparation on the bikes and get our jerseys ready, I rode
										with the following attached to my back. I do have me some
										love handles, but in my defense there are 4 packages of
										HONEYSTINGER fruit chews, keys, a cell phone, cash and
										chapstick in my jersey pockets!
									</p>

									</p>

									<p>
										The ride started off at 7:30am, we lined up for the start
										around 7:10 to try to get up front with the 100 milers. It
										was a tad chilly, Natalie could of used her jacket while we
										were standing around, but I had talked her out of taking it
										with her, as I knew once we got riding it would just be
										something extra to carry around.
									</p>

									<p>
										At 7:30 they sent the first wave off, we made it out in the
										second wave. Heading out of town they had the roads blocked
										off, so we could head out without stopping at any lights or
										stop signs for the first 3 miles. To be honest though, I
										don&rsquo;t think anyone stopped for a stop sign until well
										after mile 20&hellip; Fortunately most of the riding was
										done on the country roads of Yolo and Solano counties, so
										there wasn&rsquo;t much traffic.
									</p>

									<p>
										The ride itself was relatively flat, actually it was darn
										flat. If you notice the strava profile above you&rsquo;ll
										see it says we climbed 896 feet, over 95.8 miles. That is
										nothing, in Hawaii a couple of weeks ago we did almost 4x
										that elevation in &lt;1/3 the distance, and riding around
										here in Half Moon Bay it is easy to put that on in a 12-15
										mile ride. The weather for the ride was gorgeous, a bit cool
										to start off with, but it maybe topped out around 80 degrees
										(if that) during the ride. The wind did pick up a little
										here or there, but nothing that caused too much pain for the
										ride.
									</p>

									<p>
										This ride is a supported ride, which means there are
										water/bathroom/food stops all along the course, the first
										one being after 10 short miles. We decided that we
										wouldn&rsquo;t stop at the first one, we were only about 35
										minutes into the ride by then, so we headed on to stop #2 at
										mile 24. The stops were all well stocked, except for #4
										which was just a water tank, but you really can&rsquo;t
										complain because everything else was top notch. At the stops
										you could get water, gatorade, PBJ sandwiches, nuts, fruit
										and even HONEYSTINGER products, I&rsquo;m a fan of the
										stinger, so that was my favorite part.
									</p>

									<p>
										For the stops, we ended up skipping stop 1 and 3, but we
										stopped at the rest of them, it was nice to be able to get
										off the bike for a few minutes, expel some of the fluids we
										had been taking in, and grab a bite to eat without worrying
										about falling off the bike doing so. Ultimately we rested
										for about an hour and seven minutes according to the Strava
										route. The entire ride took us 7:10, with 1:07 of non-moving
										time.
									</p>

									<p>
										We managed to make the ride without any mishaps, no spills,
										no flats, nothing dropped or falling from the bike. At the
										end we rode across the finish line together, we probably
										could have (should have) gone another 2 miles out and back
										to get up to an even 100 miles for the day, but after a day
										of fighting off knee pain and trying to keep up with Natalie
										on the bike I was all for getting off and walking around a
										bit.
									</p>

									<p>
										Here&#39;s a short compilation video of some of our
										ride.<iframe
											frameborder="0"
											src="//www.youtube.com/embed/gaAENYQJY50?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque"
											width="100%"
										></iframe>
									</p>

									<p>
										After the ride we had some food, grabbed some drinks, and
										hit the road back to Half Moon Bay.
									</p>

									<p>
										I will go ahead and say it here now. I plan to do another,
										if not multiple, LIVESTRONG Challenge rides in 2013, even
										though we will not be in Northern California anymore (hello
										Missouri) I will plan to make the trip back out here if they
										hold one in Davis again. I would also like to try to see if
										I can raise enough money for Austin ($10k) next year, I have
										some ideas on how that can happen.
									</p>

									<p>
										I hope to build up a larger team next year, while it was fun
										riding with just me and Natalie, I think we could be far
										more efficient if there was a full team going the entire
										route shifting off duties of leading (Natalie did a lot of
										the leading due to my knee). If you are at all considering
										riding a 100 mile ride next year, considering joining the
										team.
									</p>

									<p>
										If you haven&rsquo;t touched a bike in years, never fear, I
										started riding just over year ago. I didn&rsquo;t put in any
										particular training plan for the ride, I just rode as much
										as I could starting in January, May really kind of tailed
										off besides our 100k ride and a 45 mile ride up in
										Vacaville, and June really didn&rsquo;t get enough riding
										until the event itself, but we faired pretty darn well
										I&rsquo;d say considering.
									</p>

									<p>
										Thanks to LIVESTRONG for organizing the event, thanks to
										Davis for hosting it (Davis is a great college town). Thank
										you again to all the donors for the event, thank you to my
										wife for riding it with me.
									</p>

									<p>
										And most of all because this was an event to raise money for
										LIVESTRONG and their cancer programs, this ride was for my
										best friend&rsquo;s mom Jan, my uncle John, my Auntie Carol,
										and my father Bill.
