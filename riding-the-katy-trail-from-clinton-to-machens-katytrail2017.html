												>Two of my three cycling goals were completed in the
												past few weeks</a
											>. First, I rode Pedal The Cause 2017, the century again.
											I didn't walk any this year, though I did leave out the
											Babler Beast loop this year. I was fighting a cold, and it
											was very warm, I knew if I attempted it I would struggle
											to finish the ride, so I cut it short and completed 93.4
											miles with 4600' of elevation gain on the route. A big
											thanks to everyone who helped me out this year with
											donations, I raised $650, bringing my lifetime PTC
											fundraising to $4,956.69.
										</p>

										<p>
											My second goal was riding the entire Katy Trail. I'm glad
											to say that the goal has been planned, attempted and
											completed the weekend of September 30th/October 1st 2017!
											Here are some of the stats for the ride, after that, the
											details.
										</p>
										<h2>Katy Trail Stats</h2>

										</ul>
										<h2>Planning and Logistics</h2>
										<p>
											We (Mike, Dan and Myself) started planning #KatyTrail2017
											back in January. Initially we planned to do the ride in
											May, but we were unable to get a date that worked for
											those who were interested, so we planned the ride for the
											end of September. Originally we planned to have someone
											drop us off and we would bike pack the entire trip. The
											goal for the year was that we would train throughout the
											year, riding on the Katy, getting distance in, and
											hopefully take a practice ride over a two day period where
											we would ride somewhere for the night with all our gear,
											camp, and return back to our starting point the next
											morning.
										</p>

										<p>
											The training occurred, but the trial overnight trip never
											happened. A few days before the trip my father and mother
											arrived in Missouri, completing their drive/move from
											Arizona, with their RV. We talked my father into driving
											us to our starting point (more on that below), hauling our
											gear, and then meeting us each night at our designated
											stops! It worked out great!
										</p>

										<h2>Route</h2>
										<p>
											Prior to the trip I came up with a plan for the route and
											timing that was adjusted over a few iterations. The
											<a
												href="http://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/40"
												target="_blank"
												>final pre-trip plan is posted over here</a
											>. The short version of the plan for the three day trip
											was:
										</p>
										<h3>Katy Trail Day 1</h3>
										<p>
											Start Clinton, Missouri, lunch in Sedalia Missouri, stay
											the night at the Katy Roundhouse in New Franklin,
											Missouri.
										</p>
										<h3>Katy Trail Day 2</h3>
										<p>
											Start from the Katy Roundhouse, lunch in Hartsburg,
											Missouri, stay the night in Marthasville, Missouri.
										</p>
										<h3>Katy Trail Day 3</h3>
										<p>
											Start in Marthasville, Missouri, lunch in St. Charles,
											Missouri, reach eastern terminus in Machens, Missouri and
											return to St. Charles, Missouri for pickup.
										</p>
										<h3>Changes</h3>
										<p>
											Overall we stuck to that plan, with two major (minor?)
											changes. We hit Hartsburg around 10am, way too early for
											lunch, we ended up having lunch in Mokane, Missouri. On
											Day 3 when we arrived in St. Charles, there was a Marathon
											going on, so we skipped having lunch there in favor of
											finishing in Machens and getting picked up near the end of
											the trail.
										</p>
										<h2>Prep-work</h2>
										<p>
											Getting ready for the trip I made a list of things to
											bring (<a
												href="http://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/41"
												target="_blank"
												>List of Items for Katy Trail Bicycle Ride</a
											>). On Wednesday before the trip I made sure to get some
											grocery shopping done. Because we were going to have RV
											support, we decided that we wouldn't be buying breakfast
											or dinner each day, instead we would make those meals.
											This meant we only needed to plan to purchase lunch, and
											any snacks on the way that we didn't want to carry with
											us. We ultimately only purchased lunch 2 days, and didn't
											purchase any snacks along the ride, eating what we carried
											with us. In addition to food for meals, I purchased a box
											of Honey Stinger Vanilla Waffles, some Honey Stinger Gel,
											and Honey Stinger Fruit Chews, to haul along with me on
											the ride.
										</p>

										<p>
											I was going to be sleeping in a tent that my brother had
											loaned me, so I made sure to know how to set it up before
											we headed out. I highly recommend you do that yourself
											before a trip! I also ordered a "self-inflating" sleeping
											pad, and learned that self-inflating was a pipe dream,
											though manual inflation was pretty easy to do.
										</p>
										<h2>The Trip</h2>
										<h3>Wildwood to Clinton (Day 0, driving)</h3>
										<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
										<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
										<p>
											To get started for the trip, we headed out of Wildwood,
											Missouri around 4pm on Thursday the 28th. We decided to
											take off on Thursday, drive to Marshall Junction RV Park
											in order to cut the drive down a bit on Friday morning.
											This was planned to give us more time to ride and
											hopefully more sleep the night before the ride, instead of
											getting up at 3am and heading out. We arrived at the RV
											Park after dark on Thursday evening and setup camp. Mike
											was planning on sleeping in a Hammock for the trip, but
											the Marshall Junction site didn't have a great place to
											setup the hammock, he slept in the RV for the night. Dan
											and I ended up sleeping outside, myself in my tent, and
											Dan in a
											<a
												href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/bivy-sack.html"
												target="_blank"
												>bivy sack</a
											>. Friday morning we got up early, had oatmeal or
											pop-tarts for breakfast and loaded up in the RV and headed
											south through Sedalia, towards Clinton.

											>We arrived in Clinton, got organized, and managed to get
											on the trail around 9:10am. We rode from Clinton to
											Sedalia at a pretty good clip. We had fresh legs
											(somewhat, considering I had done Pedal The Cause 5 days
											earlier), but we were a little shocked to find that the
											Katy Trail in the western half of the state is not near as
											flat as it is in the eastern half of the state. For the
											day, 78 miles, we ended up doing 1500' of ascent, not a
											large number, but definitely a lot larger than we expected
											based on our riding of the Katy Trail out east. Before
											lunch we passed the high point (see photo) of The Katy
											Trail.

											>We made it to Sedalia just before noon. We crossed the
											bridge over Highway 65, and headed off trail, north,
											through a field that dumped us onto a neighborhood street.
											We rode to the local Dairy Queen for lunch, filling up on
											food for the day. After lunch we hopped back on the trail
											and continued our way east through Sedalia.
										</p>

										<p>
											Just before the caboose in Sedalia, we came across a box,
											that had a sign that said "Baby Rattlers" with a picture
											of a rattlesnake (not rattle snakes in a freezer) on it.
											As we went by, Mike and I wondered if they could be real,
											I joked and said I bet lunch (Saturday) that they are baby
											rattles, and not rattlesnakes. So we headed back to check.
											Needless to say, Mike picked up the tab for lunch on
											Saturday.
										</p>

										<p>
											In Sedalia there is a section of the Katy Trail, from
											Griesson Road to Boonville Road that is closed. The detour
											on side streets is clearly marked (painted Katy Trail
											logos and arrows on the streets). It appears that this
											section of the trail has been out of commission since
											November 14, 2016, with no foreseeable end in sight,
											<a
												href="https://mostateparks.com/advisory/64281/temporary-detour-sedalia-katy-trail-state-park"
												target="_blank"
												>according to the Missouri State Parks site</a
											>.
										</p>

										<p>
											Outside of Sedalia we started seeing what looked like
											CD-Rom sleeves attached to the mile markers, we probably
											saw them for 20 or 30 miles. At one point, Mike stopped to
											grab one, but after picking it off the mile marker, it
											didn't have any labels/branding, but did appear to have
											data on the disk. He reattached it back to the marker.
											Shortly after that, I believe in Pilot Grove, we found
											another one attached to a bulletin board, I went ahead and
											grabbed the disk. A week after the ride I finally put the
											disk into a computer, it ended up being a DVD-ROM disk,
											and had some religious propaganda on it, looks like it is
											a film called Heaven: Our Eternal Home by Questar.
										</p>

										<p>
											I won't dignify the film with a link, but if you're
											interested you can find it on Amazon. I'll be honest, I
											really had hoped it would be something cool, maybe a
											puzzle/game, a mix tape, or something else, but religious
											propaganda, snooze. Also at the Pilot Grove stop there
											were some painted rocks,
											<a
												href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/36775273284/in/dateposted/"
												target="_blank"
												>labeled "Sedalia Rocks!",</a
											>
											I wish I had picked two of those up for my kids instead of
											that DVD.
										</p>

										<p>
											The rest of Day One was fairly uneventful, though if
											you're coming into
											<a
												href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/37453827932/in/dateposted/"
												target="_blank"
												>Boonville</a
											>
											from the west on the Katy Trail, be sure to watch the
											signage closely. I missed an arrow on the street and ended
											up at the old rail bridge, which is out of service, trying
											to cross the river. Ended up having to swing easterly
											around the casino and cross over the river using the
											bridge that vehicular traffic uses. We ended up at the
											Katy Roundhouse after crossing over the bridge and around
											a little bit of construction traffic, to get setup for the
											night.
										</p>

										<p>
											Camping at the Katy Roundhouse was easy, my father was
											already there in his RV, setup. After arriving I took a
											seat for about 20 minutes before getting up and starting
											to get the tent setup for the night. Showers and restrooms
											are available if you're camping (paying) at the Katy
											Roundhouse, there is also power outlets on the shower
											building if you need to recharge devices. For dinner we
											ended up cooking hotdogs and two boxes of mac and cheese.
											I think I was in my tent by 8pm, and asleep before 8:45
											after turning my phone off.

											>We started off day 2 off with breakfast (eggs), and hit
											the trail at 7:15am, making great time to McBaine,

											Missouri. If you're able to, check this tree out. It isn't
											far off the Katy Trail, make a right (south) on Burr Oak
											Road. From McBaine we rode on to Hartsburg, which was
											originally our planned lunch stop. We arrived there just
											around 10am, and decided it was too early for lunch. We
											did get some great snacks though, the DAR (Daughters of
											the American Revolution) were hosting a Wheeled Warriors
											bicycle ride on the Katy Trail for the day, they supplied
											us with Gatorade, bananas, candy and granola bars for our
											efforts.
										</p>

										<p>
											From Hartsburg we headed further east, making our way over
											towards Jefferson City, there was another DAR station at
											the North Jefferson stop on the Katy Trail. We continued
											through the stop, but ended up stopping on the trail about
											a mile later. My legs were finally starting to feel
											extremely tired, so I grabbed a bench for a short break
											and snack. Mike and Dan stopped with me, I was feeling
											pretty frustrated at this point, and told them to head on
											without me, I felt like I was holding them back (I was).
											Fortunately for me they stuck with me and made sure I
											finished the day.
										</p>

										<p>
											Shortly after the bench stop, I realized that my rear tire
											was low, so we stopped and pumped the tire up. My hand
											pump didn't appear to work, so thankfully Dan had a hand
											pump that worked much better. We ended up fighting the
											leaking tire for the next couple of hours, hoping to find
											a floor pump at one of the stops along the way, but being
											unable to do so I ended up throwing a tube in the tire (it
											was setup for tubeless). Once were were able to get the
											tube in, the rear tire held air well the rest of the trip.
										</p>

										<p>
											Throughout the day we passed, and then were passed by, a
											couple of gentlemen from the St. Louis area. They had
											taken the train to Lee's Summit, and took the Rock Island
											Spur from Pleasant Hill to Windsor where it joins the Katy
											Trail. I believe they stayed in Hartsburg (maybe it was
											somewhere else) for their second night. We swapped trail
											positions with them off and on throughout Saturday,
											primarily due to my tired legs and leaky tire. We were
											keeping a faster pace as they were loaded down with all
											their gear, but due to my frequent stops they kept
											catching up with us. We had the opportunity to chat with
											them a bit, at one stop they asked if I was
											<a href="http://www.chrishammond.com/'" target="_blank"
												>Chris Hammond</a
											>, and if I know Dave Whitworth, it's funny where you run
											into former autocrossers.
										</p>

										<p>
											We ended up having lunch in
											<a
												href="http://www.bikekatytrail.com/mokane-bar-and-grill.aspx"
												target="_blank"
												>Mokane Bar &amp; Grill</a
											>
											there in Mokane, Missouri. I will tell you, there isn't
											much to Mokane. The Bar And Grill serves a cheap meal,
											with plenty of tater tots, and cold drinks! If you're
											looking for a place to stop, you can stop by there. We
											ended up not locking the bikes up, I left the chain in the
											RV on Day 2, no problems at the B&amp;G. We had hoped to
											fill my leaky tubeless tire in Mokane, but the stop there
											didn't have a bicycle pump, so we just used the hand pump
											and rode on hoping to get to the next stop with some
											tools.
										</p>

										<p>
											We continued on for the ride and passed through Portland,
											Bluffton, Rhineland, McKittrick and then Hermann. By this
											point my legs were really struggling, but Mike stayed
											right there in front of me and pulled me through the wind.
											Did I mention that we had a headwind for Days 2 and 3? Day
											1 we had the wind at our backs, but not the other two
											days. Having Mike there sure helped, I know it wasn't fun
											for him to pull me the whole way, but it sure helped me
											finish.
										</p>

										<p>
											At the end of Day 2 we pulled into Marthasville. We
											weren't quite sure where to go, there were ball fields
											south of the trail, but I thought there might be a park up
											north of the trail that we were supposed to camp at.
											Luckily I saw that my dad was parked at the Marthasville
											Community Club park, which is the ball fields south of the
											trail, he had the RV plugged in (110v) and we settled down
											there for the night. Mike actually went on for another few
											miles, needing another 3 miles to reach his lifetime
											milestone for distance in one ride. I ended up meeting
											mine with 112 miles on Day 2. Next time, unless I'm going
											for a KT record, I think we'll cut day 2 a little shorter.
										</p>

										<p>
											The park in Marthasville has hot showers, a restroom and
											access to a bar and grill, as well as a convenience store
											not far away. About an hour before we finished the ride I
											remembered I hadn't taken the hamburger meat out of the
											freezer in the RV that morning, so we weren't going to be
											eating hamburgers. We ended up having hotdogs and mac and
											cheese again for Saturday night dinner. In addition we
											also broke out the bag of Fritos. After my rough day on
											the bike, I decided I was going to spend my last night
											sleeping in the RV instead of my tent. I ended up freezing
											in the RV, should of taken my sleeping bag in there with
											me! I may have actually slept better the night before in
											the tent.

											>The third day started with Pop-Tarts for everyone (brown
											sugar cinnamon, warmed up in the toaster of course) and a
											beautiful sunrise in Marthasville. We weren't quite sure
											where we were going to finish our ride. Originally we
											planned to stop in St. Charles for lunch, ride to Machens
											at the end, and then return to St. Charles to get picked
											up. We had heard that the trail might be closed before
											Machens, and verified that via the Missouri State parks
											website. This left us with either 40, 52, or 64 miles
											depending on how far we went and how far back we came to
											get picked up. After riding for two days, we decided we
											were going to skip lunch and try to have my father pick us
											up somewhere near where highway 370 crosses the Katy
											Trail.
										</p>

										<p>
											After our healthy breakfast, we quickly hit the trail with
											the intention of trying to get to St. Charles in 3 hours,
											and finish our ride before noon so that we could head off
											to various kids sports games that were scheduled on Sunday
											afternoon. We made great time, reaching Defiance before
											taking our first break. From there we rode to the Page
											Extension where we were going to take a break. It turned
											into a short break because we saw a sign for the Big River
											Running company, and after inquiring, were told that there
											was a marathon taking place. The leaders from the marathon
											were coming down on the trail as we took our break, so we
											cut it short to try to get back out in front of them as to
											avoid traffic.
										</p>

										<p>
											Well, traffic was not avoided. We ended up running into
											the pack of runners coming the other direction on the Katy
											Trail out of St. Charles. The biggest congestion points
											were the feed/water stations for the runners, with
											volunteers there not paying attention to any trail traffic
											coming from the opposite direction. The marathon, and
											shorter distances, were finishing right in downtown St.
											Charles, on the Katy Trail, which created a huge mess. We
											ended up getting off our bikes and walking in the thick of
											it.

											>Once we made it through the masses in St. Charles we
											hopped back on the bikes hoping to ride to Machens. True
											to the messaging posted on the state park website, between
											Mile Marker 35 and 34, the trail was in-fact marked as
											closed, but the orange fencing didn't cover the entire
											trail, so we decided to ride on until we reached a point
											that was impassable.
										</p>

										<p>
											On this section of trail, we reached the lowest point of
											the Katy Trail. You could tell that there had been
											flooding there, but I honestly don't know why the trail
											would be marked as closed in this section. It was very
											passable and safe, we saw multiple people along this
											section of the trail as well.
										</p>

										<p>
											From there it was a race to the end of the trail in
											Machens. Okay, we didn't race except for the last 1/4 mile
											or so, I was still too tired to push too hard until the
											very end. We reached the eastern terminus and celebrated.
											We actually sat there for a few minutes, soaking in all
											the glory of completing the 240 some odd miles of our
											adventure. From there we called my dad to see where he was
											parked, and organize how we were going to get picked up.
											We had absolutely zero motivation to ride back towards St.
											Charles, so I pulled out Google Maps to locate the nearest
											road we could ride to in hopes of finding somewhere that
											dad could get the RV pulled off and bikes loaded up.
										</p>

										<p>
											We managed to get up off of Highway 94, and Dad picked us
											up there for the ride back to my house in Wildwood.
										</p>

										<p>Here's a group shot from the finish.</p>

										<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
										<p>
											If you are planning on riding the Katy Trail as your first
											multi-day bike trip, it is a great trail for that. Here
											are some of the things I learned on my first bike trip.
										</p>

										<p>
											Wear chamois cream, you might not want to, but trust me. I
											didn't the first half of the first day and paid the price
											with some chaffing the remaining two days. Fortunately I
											was only chaffed a bit, and not too sore on the seat the
											whole way.
										</p>

										<p>
											I definitely do not recommend trying to do it completely
											self supported in 3 days. If we had been carrying all of
											our gear, there is no way we would have made the time that
											we were able to make. My legs definitely would have
											stopped working if I had the bike loaded down with another
											10-20lbs of gear (guessing at weight here). If you've got
											someone supporting you, carrying most of your gear, the
											ride is definitely doable in 3 days. We probably could
											have saved 20 or 30 miles from Day 2, and completed the
											distance on Day 3 instead, saving some of the extra effort
											of doing 112 miles that day. If I were to change anything,
											I simply would have taken my Camelbak and some food, I
											didn't need a rear bag, or frame bag for this trip
											supported.
										</p>

										<p>
											Another thing I wish we had done was taken more time to
											enjoy the views, the stops, the friends. We were pushing
											it pretty hard for 3 days, and while it was a great ride
											and great effort, we didn't get near as much time as I
											think we all would have liked to stop and smell the roses
											a bit more.
										</p>

										<p>
											If you're considering riding the Katy Trail, definitely
											get out and ride the Katy a lot before hand. Get to know
											the surface. It is an interesting surface, a crushed
											limestone I believe. The trail is pretty darn flat (at
											least most of it) so you will not have many hills to
											climb, or descents to bomb. You will be pedaling, a LOT.
											The trail slows you down if you stop pedaling, so get
											those legs used to turning over and over and over again,
											for hours at a time!
										</p>

										<p>
											Be sure to plan out your stops for where water and
											services will be available. After riding the Katy many
											hundreds of miles on the eastern side, we expected every
											stop to be like Augusta or Marthasville, and they most
											definitely are not. Some stops have bathrooms, some have
											water, some have both. Some stops even have bike tools,
											but it's pretty much guaranteed the stop where you need
											the bike tools won't have them.
										</p>
										<h2>What comes next?</h2>
										<p>
											What comes next for riding? Well, I've taken a week off,
											and due to travel this week, will not likely be on a bike
											again until this coming weekend. I'm hoping to get out on
											the Niner Air this weekend and get started on mountain
											biking. At some point, maybe next year, I'll plan another
											big bike trip. While riding the Katy we tossed around the
											idea of
											<a href="http://www.ragbrai.com/" target="_blank"
												>RAGBRAI</a
											>, so, maybe we'll look into that.
										</p>
										<h2>Finally, Thanks!</h2>
										<p>It is time to dole out the thank yous for this ride.</p>

										<p>
											First, to my father Bill Hammond, from myself, Mike and
											Dan, thank you for supporting us on the ride! Without you
											getting us there, meeting us each night, and hauling our
											gear, the ride would have been a lot more difficult!
										</p>

										<p>
											Second and Third, to Dan and Mike, thank you for joining
											me on this adventure. It was a great year of riding
											getting trained up for the ride. Without you guys I
											wouldn't have finished, thanks for putting up with me.
										</p>

										<p>
											To my wife, thank you for allowing me to do this! Next
											time you are doing it to like we originally planned!
										</p>

										<p>
											To my mother, thank you for watching the kids while I was
											off riding bicycles and Natalie was off playing Crossfit
											for the weekend.
										</p>

										<p>
											And finally, thank you to my brother Greg, the Niner
											bicycle was awesome! Anyone who is looking for a new bike,
											be sure to check out
