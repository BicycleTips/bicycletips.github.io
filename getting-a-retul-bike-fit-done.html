										</p>

										<p>
											It has been a while since I've blogged here on BicycleTips
											and it is time to get started again! Less than 2 months
											remains until I ride the 100 mile distance at the Dirty
											Kanza #DK100 in the hills of Kansas, so it is time to dust
											off the bike, dust off the keyboard, and get to stroking
											the pedals and the keys.
										</p>

										<p>
											So I'm riding in the #DK, how did that happen? Well
											earlier this year a couple of us at the gym decided we
											were going to enter the lottery. When entering the lottery
											for the Dirty Kanza, you have the option of entering by
											yourself, or putting down a TEAM name (up to 4 riders I
											think). If you put down a team name, and someone from your
											team gets selected, everyone gets in. I don't believe that
											I was selected individually for the ride, but the other
											guy who ended up signing up, we'll call him Steve, was
											selected, and thus I was pulled in as well!
										</p>

										<p>
											I'm not going to get into "what" the Dirty Kanza is, other
											than to say it is a gravel ride in the Flint Hills of
											Kansas, and is known as a tough event (race). We'll be
											riding the 100 mile distance, which is unsupported, and
											has one supply zone in the middle (50 miles) where you can
											have someone resupply you with food/drink/gear.
										</p>

										<p>
											In prep for the DK, I decided it was time to try to get my
											Niner RLT gravel bike sized a little more appropriately.
											When we did the Katy Trail ride in 2017, I didn't feel
											like I was as efficient as I should/could be on the bike,
											and I didn't want to relive some of that pain, so I booked
											a bike fitting at Trailhead Bicycles in Ellisville, MO.
											The fitting at Trailhead uses the Retul Bike Fit system.
										</p>

										<p>
											This was my first time getting fitted on a bike, so I
											wasn't 100% sure what to expect. Prior to the fitting I
											was told to bring:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Shoes/Cleats/Pedals</li>
											<li>Kit (shorts/shirt) to ride in</li>
											<li>Bike</li>
											<li>Bottle of water</li>
											<li>Snack</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											I booked the appointment for 4pm, and arrived shortly
											before that to try on a new pair of shoes that I had
											ordered (figured it was time to upgrade my 10 year old MTB
											shoes I've been using). Once I tried the shoes on we began
											the process for the Retul Fit.
										</p>
										<h2>Interview</h2>
										<p>
											The first step in the process was an interview, the bike
											fitter (technician?) Harrison asked me a series of
											questions. Height, Weight, DOB, any prior injuries, pain
											areas, average number/length of rides, etc. This is pretty
											simple, not sure how useful it is, though you might want
											to think of issues you have while riding before your
											fitting, I thought of a couple of things post interview
											that I spoke about, would probably have been more helpful
											if I had them written down ahead of time.
										</p>
										<h2>Sit Bones and Foot Arch</h2>
										<p>
											After the interview the next thing I went through was
											checking my sit bones. If you're new to riding, your
											saddle (seat) is one of the most important things about
											your bike, being comfortable on long rides. It isn't about
											having the most padding, honestly most good saddles have
											minimal padding. To measure the sit bones I sat down on a
											tablet like device that measured the distance between my
											sit bones, the points that typically touch the seat on
											your ride. My measurement put me about 155mm, while the
											saddle on my bike measured around 143mm. I have often
											found that I sat crooked on a bike, I think we finally
											figured out why. With the measurement done we picked out a
											new saddle for me, the
											<a
												href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/power-expert/p/155978?color=230517-155978"
												target="_blank"
												>Specialized Power Expert</a
											>
											in the 155mm width.
										</p>

										<p>
											In addition to the saddle fitting, before near the bike
											Harrison had me sit and put my feet on a touch sensitive
											pad that measured the arch on my feet. Sitting I had a
											fairly high arch. He then had me stand and measure how
											much my arch collapsed, to which we were both surprised
											that my arch didn't collapse at all while standing (I'm a
											big guy, and have had some foot pain in the past, so I
											assumed it was an arch issue). This told us that I might
											benefit from some arch support to help keep my high arch
											while riding, but they didn't have any insoles in my size,
											so they had to order those.
										</p>
										<h2>Cleats</h2>
										<p>

												width="1359"
											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											From there I tried on my "new" shoes that I had ordered a
											few days before my fitting. I ordered the
											<a
												href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/expert-xc-mountain-bike-shoes/p/156134?color=239675-156134"
												target="_blank"
												>Specialized Expert XC Mountain Bike Shoes</a
											>, in an understated color. The shoes fit great, so I was
											then measured to see where the cleats should be mounted.
											The position decided was fully to the rear of the
											adjustment range. I have never had my cleats this far
											back, but the fitting was being done for a purpose so I
											went with that decision.
										</p>
										<h2>Flexibility</h2>
										<p>
											From there we went through some flexibility movements and
											measurements. I believe my mobility was pretty good for a
											guy my size (6'4" 250lbs), primarily due to my work in the
											gym for the past year. I won't get into all the specific
											measurements and movements, but angles were measured at my
											hips, knees and even flexibility in my feet/ankle.
										</p>
										<h2>On the Bike</h2>
										<p>
											After going through the various steps, it was time to get
											outfitted for the bike. I was decked out in my kit
											already, but before getting on the bike I needed to be
											outfitted in velcro, for all of the sensors. Sensors were
											placed on the both sides of my body, on my shoe, ankle,
											knee, hip, shoulder, elbow and wrist. The sensors are part
											of the Retul fit system, which consists of a device that
											looks like a very large Microsoft Kinect, that records the
											data from the sensors and the various movements the body
											makes while riding. Once I was fitted with sensors I got
											on the bike and rode a bit to get warmed up, so that the
											system could record my initial data.
										</p>

										<p>
											My bike was mounted to a Kinetic trainer, all of which sat
											on a platform that could be rotated around 360 degrees,
											locking every 180, so that it was easy to transition
											between left and ride side recording.
										</p>

										<p>
											One thing to prepare yourself for while doing a fitting is
											riding, you'll get quite a bit of seat time. There is
											plenty of "break" in between, but you'll ride more than
											you might think ahead of time.
										</p>
										<h2>Saddle</h2>
										<p>
											Once we got some basic riding in we started by working on
											my position on the bike by swapping my current saddle out
											with the new one from Specialized, in doing so the saddle
											was moved back a big, trying to bring my knee back towards
											the pedal more, instead of it being out in front of my
											foot/pedal at the measurement point. My saddle height was
											also adjusted to get the optimum power out of the position
											as well. We started off with my seat level, but ultimately
											brought the nose down a bit to see if that helps with some
											numbness I have had previously on long rides.
										</p>
										<h2>Hoods, Stem and Bar Height</h2>
										<p>
											After working on the saddle and the rear of the bike we
											moved forward, to the hoods. Immediately we raised the
											hood angle up, bringing them more upright, without
											adjusting the actual bars themselves. While working on the
											front of the bike Harrison put the bars into an adjustable
											stem, which allowed us to move them forward and back
											easily for fitment purposes. The stem on my Niner RLT was
											90mm, and he thought that might be too long based on the
											measurements we were taking, so we shifted to an 80mm
											adjustment and that brought me in line with the desired
											measurements. Trailhead didn't have an 80mm stem that
											would work on the racks, so they ended up taking one off
											another bike, not the idea setup, but it go us through the
											fitment. I may order a lighter stem here soon, but we'll
											see if I want to drop more cash.
										</p>

										<p>
											The last adjustment we ended up making was the bar height,
											we took one spacer out lowering the height just a bit.
										</p>
										<h2>Finally</h2>
										<p>
											After all the adjustments were made, the shop owner gave
											the bike a once over, rewrapped my bars (due to the hood
											adjustments) and then they sent me on my way. I was
											instructed to take the bike out on 5 or 6 rides and then
											have a follow up fitment. I stopped by the shop today to
											schedule that follow up for next Tuesday. The fitment
											itself took just over three hours, it is pricey, and even
											more so when you start adding in equipment (shoes, saddle,
											stem), but I believe it is worth it for a serious rider
											(something I want to be).
										</p>

										<p>
											I've been on the bike 6 times for about 120 miles, and
											overall I am very pleased with the fitment. I think the
											biggest improvement is the new saddle, it is so darn
											comfortable, though the longest ride I've done is only 30
											miles, I'm hoping to get out for 40 or 50 miles this
											weekend before the follow-up. I don't find that I am super
											more efficient on my gravel bike now, it is still slower
											on the road that my road bike, but I am comfortable now,
											and that should help to minimize pain and discomfort at
											the Dirty Kanza 100 on June 1st, 2019.
