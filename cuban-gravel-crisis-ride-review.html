										<p>
											October 2019 brought gravel weather to the Midwest, and
											the first big event of the season was the Cuban Gravel
											Crisis, in Cuba, Missouri on October 12th. This year the
											ride started in Hood Park, which is where the Crawford
											County fair is held. I realized once we got there that I
											had been there, almost 20 years ago, shooting photos at a
											concert for a local band from Cuba called N2Versatle.
										</p>

										<p>
											The CGC offered 3 ride lengths, 100/50/25, with the 100
											starting at 7am and the 50/25 starting at 9am. I met the
											posse at CrossFit Wildwood and we headed down together in
											the Tahoe. This ride brought together the DK100 (Steve and
											Lybarger) crew and added in the mustached wonder of
											Wagner, we were team 3 Chrises and a Steve. Cuba was just
											over an hour away from the gym, so it was an easy drive
											down 44, a road so familiar from my many trips to/from
											Rolla for school years ago (I met n2Versatle as a DJ at
											the college radio station back in the day).
										</p>

										<p>
											We knew going into the ride that it was going to be a cold
											one, with start time forecasts showing 32-34 degrees. What
											we were not prepared for was how cold that would be! While
											waiting in line for the check in we quickly were brought
											up to speed on what Winter is like, because we had
											forgotten&hellip;. Missouri skipped Fall for a weekend,
											though&nbsp; now, two weeks later the weather was finally
											back into fall mode, today however it is going to get up
											towards 70. At check in we received our packages, which
											contained a bib number and timing chip. I mistakenly
											removed my timing chip, assuming that I needed to put it
											on my helmet, before realizing they had stabled the chip
											to the number so that we didn't need to mount it
											externally.
										</p>

										<p>
											We headed to the only warm place on site, the restroom,
											and prepped before getting the bikes ready. I've really
											taken to utilizing the Chamois Butter this year. With
											that, in combination with my new Specialized Power Expert
											saddle from Trailhead earlier this year, my riding has
											never been more comfortable! Bike prep was pretty straight
											forward, get your bottles together, computer turned on,
											air in the tires.
										</p>

										<p>
											The real prep was clothing! I was wearing my Pearl Izumi
											thermal full length bib, wool socks, and a long sleeve
											Hincapie jersey. On my head I wore a PI head band to cover
											my ears, and threw on a Maxxis neck gaiter I got at Dirty
											Kanza this year. On my hands I wore a pair of warmer Craft
											gloves, and had those inserted into my bar mitts I had
											installed the night before on the Niner RLT. The Bar
											Mitts, holy cow, I can't recommend them enough. After
											about 15 miles I had to take my gloves off and go with a
											much thinner pair, because the combo of the Craft gloves
											and bar mitts were causing my hands to be downright hot.
										</p>

										<p>
											Caution on the bar mitts though. They can be cumbersome,
											and get in the way. They limit your grip options on a drop
											bar bike, leaving you unable to access the drops, but in
											cold weather, they are totally worth it.
										</p>

										<p>
											The ride started by heading out of hood park on an old
											gravel road following the train tracks that runs along
											side of Historic Route 66. The start felt a little
											unorganized, it was hard to hear the announcers due to the
											size of the crowd and distance from the PA, but once on
											the road things started to spread out. The road was marked
											with painted arrows, which worked out well for the most
											part, with only a couple of minor problems for people who
											either couldn't get their route isnto their bike computer
											(looking at you Wagner) or people who missed the arrows
											when marked poorly (also looking at you Wagner).

										<p>
											For the most part, the three Chrises rode in the near
											vicinity of each other all day, while Steve was a little
											further back riding his mountain bike with MTB tires
											mounted, instead of his gravel tires. We all stopped at
											the rest stop around mile 15 in Steeleville, and then
											again around mile 25 when Wagner hit a gravel pothole that
											helped to alleviate the air from the tire on his ride. He
											quickly popped the tube off of the rim of the bike, to
											discover that the sealant used on his tubeless setup had
											turned into Loctite for the nut holding his valve stem in.
											He was going to pop a tube in and keep riding. We should
											have simply tried filling it up with air, before popping
											the bead on the tire.
										</p>

										<p>
											We spent the next 28 minutes trying to figure out how to
											get the nut off the valve stem. We asked every rider who
											went by if they had a pair of pliers, no one did. No one
											had a Leatherman, we were stuck. Mike Weiss from Bike
											Shark Bicycle Company stopped with an old car racing
											friend of mine, Bryan. Mike and Bryan both attempted to
											get the nut off, to no avail as well. Until finally a
											rider stopped, he had acquired a new tool the prior week,
											and while it wasn't exactly pliers, it was close enough to
											pliers that Mike was able to get the nut free. Wagner
											threw a tube in the tire, pumped it back up and we were on
											our way again.
										</p>

										<p>
											Not long after the tire change, we county road E, which
											lead us down towards Cave Rd, which was going to be a
											quite the climb, followed by a jaunt through Onandaga Cave
											State Park, another location I visited 20 years ago (to
											the month) for the wedding of a pair of friends. These two
											climbs were tough, but they had to be done if we wanted to
											finish the ride, so we pushed through and rode on. Shortly
											after Onandaga, Wagner pulled away from myself and
											Lybarger as he is always much stronger on the hills than I
											am.
										</p>

										<p>
											Lybarger and I knew there was a rest stop coming up near
											Leasburg, but we weren't quite sure how far away it was.
											We ended up stopping about 1/4 mile beforehand to take a
											break and refuel, only to find the stop shortly there
											after and take another break. We almost missed the turn
											for the stop as the only marking I saw was on the left, on
											the inside of the left hand turn, thankfully my navigation
											was working. Unfortunately for Wagner, he missed this turn
											and end up with an extra 4 miles before the rest stop
											outside of Leasburg.
										</p>

										<p>
											After the rest stop, I was feeling extra lethargic and
											Lybarger headed off ahead of me. We both knew we were
											close, within the last 12 or 13 miles. Those are always
											the worst, the final slog, when the body wants you to
											stop, but you keep telling it that you are almost done and
											can rest later. Coming into the finish, much later than
											initially planned, both due to the 30 minute mechanical,
											and more so due to the 5k feet of climbing that the route
											had, was a welcome experience. The crowds of my last
											couple of bigger rides (DK and Pedal The Cause) were
											non-existent, but the finish was just as nice.&nbsp; I
											came through and immediately rode back to the Tahoe to get
											off the bike.
										</p>

										<p>
											Lybarger came over, with food in hand and pointed me
											towards a tent and food truck parked not too far away. I
											walked over to those to see what sustenance I could find.
											I found some pork sliders for $2 a pop, I got 2, and a
											soda from the food truck next door. Not the biggest meal,
											but enough to hold me over as I waited for Wagner and
											Steve to finish their rides.
										</p>

										<p>
											When they were finished we quickly loaded up and hit the
											road back to St. Louis. I had to get home to some family
											things, so we couldn't stick around, and didn't even have
											time to stop anywhere on the way home to grab some food.
										</p>

										<p>
											Overall this event was great. Beautiful route, HOLY HILLS
											there was a lot of elevation. Definitely a ride to look
											forward to again in 2020!
										</p>
